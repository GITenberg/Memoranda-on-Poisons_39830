<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE">EDITOR’S PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>The present edition of Dr. Tanner’s &#8220;Memoranda
on Poisons&#8221; is in some respects almost a new book.
It was, as will be seen by the Author’s Preface to
the last Edition, Dr. Tanner’s object to furnish
the practitioner with a useful guide to his duties
in cases of poisoning. Experience has, however,
shown that the book is more useful to the student
than to the practitioner; and, with a view to render
it still more valuable to the former, it has in
great measure been remodelled. Whilst, therefore,
due attention has been paid to what might
be called the clinical aspects of poisoning, its
chemical bearings have been more closely attended
to; and the more important and reliable tests
have in each instance been given, as have also
the more important processes for separating
poisons from organic admixture. Sick of the old
and clumsy classification of poisons into Irritants,
Narcotics, and Narcotico-Irritants, the editor has
endeavored to form some more rational groups of
toxic agents. These groups are, it is true, quite
provisional; and they are somewhat similar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
those adopted by Dr. Guy in his admirable textbook
on Forensic Medicine. They have, however,
been worked out independently, whether they
be worth anything or no. Briefly they are
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>Corrosives.&mdash;Simple Irritants, Mineral, Vegetable,
and Animal.&mdash;Irritant Gases.&mdash;Specific Irritants,
Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal.&mdash;Neurotics:
subdivided into Narcotics, Anæsthetics,
Inebriants, Delirants, Convulsives, Hyposthenisants,
Depressants, Asphyxiants,&mdash;and Abortives.</p>

<p>Such a grouping is far from perfect; but it
would be impossible to have anything worse than
that still in general use. It is with the hope of
rendering this little volume more generally useful
these changes have been made: a reason at all
times all-powerful with its lamented Author.</p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</a><br />
TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p>These Memoranda are intended to refresh the
memory of the practitioner on a subject which is
not brought under his notice so frequently as
many other departments of medicine. They are
especially adapted to show at a glance the treatment
to be adopted in each particular instance
of poisoning to which a medical man is liable to
be summoned.</p>

<p>There seems reason to fear that the crime of
slow poisoning is more extensively practised in
the present day than is generally believed. The
study of the following pages will, it is hoped, put
the physician on his guard; and prevent his
attributing to natural disease symptoms due to
the villainous administration of deadly drugs.</p>

<h2><a name="TOXICOLOGICAL_MEMORANDA" id="TOXICOLOGICAL_MEMORANDA">TOXICOLOGICAL MEMORANDA.</a></h2>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<h3>DEFINITION AND MODE OF ACTION OF POISONS.</h3>

<p class="p2">Toxicology (τοξικὸν poison, and λόγος discourse,)
is that branch of medical science which treats of
the nature, properties, and effects of poisons.</p>

<p>It appears scarcely possible to give any definition
of a poison which will bear a critical examination;
insomuch that some have preferred to deal
with the evil effects of any substance, that is
<i>poisoning</i>, rather than with the substance itself, the
so-called <i>poison</i>. Most medicines are poisonous in
improper doses; and even common salt (chloride
of sodium) has caused death.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Dr. Guy defines
a poison to be any substance which, when applied
to the body externally, or in any way introduced
into the system, without acting mechanically, but
by its own inherent qualities, is capable of destroying
life. A cherrystone may cause death by becoming
arrested in the vermiform appendix, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
thus producing peritonitis; boiling water may
cause death also; but neither are poisons: the one
acting mechanically, the other by its heat merely.</p>

<p>Any substance which can injure the health or
destroy life is regarded as a poison, if given with
the <i>intent</i> to do mischief. The words of the statute
(1 Vict. c. 85, sec. 2) are&mdash;&#8220;Whoever shall administer,
or cause to be taken by any person, any poison,
or other destructive thing, with intent to commit
murder, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted
thereof shall suffer death.&#8221; Sometimes
poisons are administered, not for the purpose of
destroying life, but of causing some slight injury or
annoyance. An Act passed in March, 1860 (23 Vict.
c. 8), provides for the punishment of a guilty person
under these circumstances. If life be endangered,
or &#8220;grievous bodily harm&#8221; result, the administrator
may be found guilty of felony, and sentenced to
penal servitude for a term not exceeding ten years.
If the intent be only to &#8220;injure, aggrieve, or annoy,&#8221;
the crime is reduced to a misdemeanor,
punishable with an imprisonment for not more than
three years.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Pharmacy Act certain
substances have been defined as poisons within the
meaning of the Act, so as to put some restriction on
their sale to the public.</p>

<p>Poisons may be introduced into the body in various
ways and in various forms. Thus they may
be administered by the mouth or by the rectum,
and they may be given in the form of solids, liquids,
or gases, uncombined, or mixed with various matters.
Some agents are more readily absorbed than
others; whilst some textures permit of absorption
taking place more quickly through them than other
tissues. Thus, the most diffusible poisons prove
most rapidly fatal, especially when introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
directly into the circulation by a wound in a vein,
or when they are injected into the subcutaneous
connective tissue. Their action is also speedy
when applied either in a gaseous state to the pulmonary
air-cells, or as a fluid to that of the stomach
or intestines. The serous membranes, too, possess
an activity of absorption almost superior to that
of the mucous membranes; while absorption
through the skin is slow, on account of the cuticle.
Poisons taken into the stomach when that viscus
is empty, necessarily act much more speedily than
when it is full. It is remarkable that the agents
which most affect the nervous system do not appear
to act at all when applied directly to the brain or
trunks of nerves. There are also some poisons, as
that of the viper, which, although most deadly
when introduced into the blood through a wound,
are harmless when swallowed.</p>

<p>The effects of poisons may be considered as <i>local</i>
and <i>remote</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>local</i> effects are mainly of three kinds, viz.,
<i>corrosion</i>, or chemical decomposition, as is seen in
the effects of the strong mineral acids and alkalies;
<i>irritation</i> or <i>inflammation</i>, varying from simple redness,
in its mildest, to ulceration and gangrene, in
its most severe degree, such as may result from
the use of corrosive sublimate; and <i>a local specific
effect</i>, produced on the sentient extremities of the
nerves, as is felt on the local application of prussic
acid, aconite, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>remote</i> effects are those influencing organs
remote from the part to which the poison has been
applied. These may be either common or specific;
<i>common</i>, such as the constitutional indications of
inflammatory fever, however produced; <i>specific</i>, like
the constitutional effects of opium over and above
its local influences in relieving pain, &amp;c. Various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
narcotic poisons produce but little local change,
though their remote effects are very remarkable.
For example, belladonna, in whatever way it may
be introduced into the system, paralyzes the ciliary
nerves and so causes dilatation of the pupil. Many
substances have both a local and remote action, as
is well seen in the influence of cantharides upon
the part to which they are applied, and their remote
effects upon the urinary organs.</p>

<p>These remote effects must be induced by one of
two modes, or, as some contend, by both: by
<i>absorption</i>, that is, by the passage of the poisonous
particles into the blood; or by <i>sympathy</i>, that is,
by an impression transmitted through the nerves.</p>

<p>In the present day every one allows that poisons
may become absorbed, and that, provided they produce
poisonous effects at all, they are absorbed, in
whatever way they may have been applied to the
body. But it is sometimes asked, Is this absorption
necessary for their action? The following
evidence may be briefly noticed as in some degree
affording an affirmative answer to this question.
Magendie divided all the parts of one of the posterior
extremities of a dog, the artery and vein
being reconnected by quills, so as to preclude the
possibility of the effects being conveyed by the
nervous filaments supplying the coats of the vessels;
on applying a portion of upas tieuté to a
wound in the foot, the symptoms of poisoning
occurred, and death took place in ten minutes. If
the veins leading from a poisoned part be tied, the
arterial and nervous communication being complete,
the symptoms of poisoning do not occur.
Mr. Blake introduced some prussic acid into the
stomach of a dog, through an opening in its parietes,
after he had ligatured the vessel entering
the liver (the vena portæ, which, directly or indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>rectly,
receives the gastric veins); no effect ensued
until the removal of the ligature, within one minute
of which proceeding the poison began to act.
And lastly, not only has prussic acid been discovered
in the blood of an animal which perished in
thirty-five seconds, but in some experiments made
by Mr. Erichsen, in a case of extroversion of the
bladder, prussiate of potass was found in the urine
within one minute of its being swallowed on an
empty stomach.</p>

<p>The chief argument in favor of a <i>sympathetic</i> or
direct nerve action, is the almost instantaneous
manner in which some poisons act; fatal effects occurring,
it is said, before sufficient time has elapsed
to allow of absorption. It has, however, been
proved that the round of the circulation may be
accomplished much more speedily than has been
imagined. Thus, the ferrocyanide of potassium
injected into the jugular vein of a horse was discovered
throughout the entire venous system in
twenty-seconds; and Mr. Blake has inferred from
his experiments that a poison may be diffused
through the body in nine seconds. It may therefore
be concluded that in most instances poisons
act by being absorbed and conveyed with the
blood to the different organs which they impair,
or the nerve centres which rule the functions of
these; some paralyzing the heart when they reach
it, some affecting the brain or the spinal cord, some
stopping the play of the lungs and others acting
upon the different glands. Nevertheless, in view
of the extreme rapidity with which death is brought
about in a few instances, the possibility of a direct
shock to the nervous system causing death must
not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The action of a poison may be variously modified,
and the modifying circumstances must be carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
taken into consideration in the formation of a prognosis
and in suggesting a line of treatment.</p>

<p>The <i>quantity</i> or <i>dose</i> is the most important of
these; many substances which are deadly in large
doses being exceedingly useful as remedies in small
quantities; such are prussic acid, opium, digitalis,
arsenic, &amp;c. Then again, the <i>mechanical</i> and <i>chemical</i>
state of aggregation are all-important; a solid
being usually much less active than a fluid or a gas,
and a pure substance much more active than one
mixed with insoluble materials. Even more important
is the chemical constitution of the poisonous
agent; as already pointed out, poisonous effects result
from absorption of the poisoning body and absorption
implies solution; the more soluble, therefore,
the compound is, the more speedy are its effects,
whilst compounds insoluble in water or any of the
juices of the body are inert. It is not, however,
enough that the substance be insoluble in water;
it must be so also in the gastric juice, or it may give
rise to characteristic symptoms. Thus, calomel
is insoluble in water, yet it is a powerful medicine;
orpiment is insoluble in water, yet when swallowed,
it may give rise to symptoms of arsenical poisoning,
and so on. As already pointed out, the mode in
which the poison is introduced into the body is of
great consequence in estimating its effects. Then
again the <i>mental</i> and <i>bodily condition</i> of the recipient
must be taken into account. Thus, in excited
maniacs doses of medicines may be given without
producing any effect which in ordinary individuals
might give rise to serious consequences. The bodily
condition, especially as influenced by habit, is still
more important. It may be broadly stated, that by
gradually increasing the dose of a substance ordinarily
poisonous, in course of time enormous quantities
may be borne without producing immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
ill effects. This is especially seen in the practice of
opium eating and smoking, and in a less degree in arsenic
eating, as practised in Styria. The latter instance
is, however, contrary to the usual rule; for
whereas with vegetable substances, such as opium
the dose requires to be constantly increased to keep
up the effects, with minerals, the contrary seems to
be the case, especially with antimony and mercury,
which cannot be long given without danger to
the recipient.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>DIAGNOSIS OF POISONING&mdash;DUTIES OF THE PRACTITIONER.</h3>

<p class="p2">The chief characteristics of poisoning mentioned
by authors of repute are, that the symptoms commence
suddenly after taking any substance or
fluid into the stomach, the individual being in a
state of health; that they increase steadily, and
are uniform in their nature throughout their
course; and that they prove rapidly fatal. There
are many exceptions to these rules. Thus if the
stomach be loaded the appearance of the symptoms
will often be delayed some few hours. Sleep, according
to Dr. Christison, may retard the action of
some agents; so that if a person fall asleep soon
after swallowing arsenic or strychnia, for example,
no effect may ensue for four or five hours. Intoxication
will mask the effect of narcotics. Again,
the individual poisoned may possibly be suffering
from disease, and an agent may be given which
will only aggravate existing symptoms. The fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
must not be forgotten that sometimes a poisonous
draught is substituted for a harmless medicine.
And lastly, after a poison has manifested its effects
the symptoms often remit for a time.</p>

<p>When poison is administered with a criminal intent
it is generally in such a dose as to take immediate
effect, although this is by no means
necessary, as there are numerous substances which
accumulate in the system, and when given in small
and repeated quantities, ultimately prove fatal.
It must also be remembered that there are many
diseases, as malignant cholera, internal hemorrhage,
&amp;c., which commence suddenly, and rapidly
run to a fatal termination. In inflammation of the
stomach or intestines the symptoms often set in
suddenly, and might be mistaken for poisoning;
such is also the case in intestinal obstruction, and
especially in ulceration and perforation of the
bowels. So also in organic diseases of the heart,
where the symptoms may have remained latent
for some time, death often occurs suddenly from
syncope. The diagnosis of the effects of irritant
poisons is not so difficult as it is in the case of narcotics
or other neurotics, where the symptoms are
very similar to those produced by apoplexy, epilepsy,
tetanus, convulsions, or disease of the
brain.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a person may be supposed
to be suffering under the effects of a poison, if soon
after taking food or drink, he be seized with
violent pain, vomiting, disorder of the alimentary
canal, and convulsive movements: or if he be attacked
under the same circumstances with vertigo,
delirium, or great drowsiness. It must not be forgotten,
however, that poisons may be introduced
into the body, not only by the mouth, but also by
means of suppositories and enemata, or in females<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by vaginal injections, or by inhalation, or by subcutaneous
injection, or through the true skin after
the removal of the cuticle. Should death ensue,
the presumption of unfair play will of course be
strengthened by the discovery of post-mortem appearances
similar to those known to be produced
by the poison from which the person apparently
suffered.</p>

<p>The post-mortem appearances, however, except
in a few instances, are not very characteristic;
nevertheless they may be of great <i>negative</i> value in
proving that a certain poison has not been administered,
or that the patient died from the effects of
disease. Two symptoms, excessive lividity of the
body and early putrefaction, formerly supposed to
indicate death by poison, are now known to frequently
follow other modes of death. It may
nevertheless be remarked, that the appearances
after death which may be produced by poisons are,
in one great class, the signs of inflammation of the
alimentary canal; in another, the signs of congestion
of the nervous system; and in a third, a combination
of the two.</p>

<p>The detection of poison in some of the food
which has been left untaken or in the matters vomited
would seem to be conclusive evidence of the
administration of poison; but it is to be recollected
that designing persons have mixed noxious
materials with food or rejected matters, in order to
feign poisoning, or to cast unjust imputations upon
others.</p>

<p>When called to a case of supposed poisoning
during life the practitioner’s duty is two-fold. His
first aim must of course be to preserve life (see
next chapter); his second, to forward the interests
of justice. But if he reaches the spot too late to
save life his duties are undivided, for he has but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to see that justice is done, and in order that there
be no failure it is important that all his observations
be committed as speedily as possible to writing.
He should inquire the time at which any substance
was last taken, the nature of the symptoms, the
hour at which they commenced, and the precise
time at which death occurred. He must take possession
of any food, medicine, vomited matters,
urine, or fæces which may be in the room; and if
possible he is to seal them up, in new and clean
vessels, duly labelled, for examination. Then the
position and temperature of the body are to be
observed, the appearance of the countenance, the
presence or absence of rigor mortis, with the nature
and warmth of the apartment, the situation of any
marks of violence, and the condition of the inside
of the mouth and gullet. In addition to the ordinary
rules to be observed in conducting post-mortem
examinations in cases of suspected poisoning,
something more must be done with a view to preserving
portions of the body for subsequent examination.
The alimentary canal is the most important
organ to be thus secured, and it should
be removed in separate portions. A double ligature
should be passed round the œsophagus in the chest,
and the duodenum a few inches below the pylorus
should be secured in like manner; by cutting across
the gullet and gut between these ligatures, the
stomach may be removed without any danger of
spilling its contents. It is best to open the stomach
after it has been introduced into the receptacle
prepared for it, so that its pathological condition
may be noted as early as possible. Another ligature
should be tied low down in the rectum,
and the intestines removed and introduced into a
separate vessel prepared for them and then examined
like the stomach. Sometimes it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
necessary to remove the gullet in like fashion.
As much blood as possible should be saved for the
chemist, and a portion of the liver, if not the whole
organ, should also be secured. When everything
has been tied up, the jars should be sealed, numbered,
labelled, and initialled, to prevent subsequent
confusion and to facilitate identification.
In women the vagina, uterus and ovaries must be inspected,
the brain, spinal cord and thoracic viscera
ought likewise to be examined, and portions of
the spleen, kidneys, and muscles should be reserved
for analysis. No antiseptic or preservative fluid is
to be used. When possible it will be best to make
the autopsy within twenty-four hours after death;
taking care to make the examination patiently,
thoroughly, and with a mind free from any bias.
Poison may be found in a body, and yet a question
may arise as to its having been the cause of death.
Hence in these investigations every organ of the
body is to be examined, in order to learn whether
any disease has existed sufficient to account for
the fatal result.</p>

<p>Any suspicious conduct on the part of those
surrounding the poisoned individual should be
carefully noted. Acts of this kind arrange themselves
in three heads, as occurring before, or during
the fatal illness, or after death. With the first
category the practitioner has ordinarily nothing
to do, but his attention to those coming under the
second and third is often of essential service to
the ends of justice. The kind of acts will suggest
themselves to every one, and need not be further
referred to here.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>DUTIES OF THE PRACTITIONER&mdash;TREATMENT OF
POISONING.</h3>

<p class="p2">When the practitioner is called in to a case of
poisoning while yet there is life, he must set himself
to preserve it in whatever way he best can; in
this of course he must be guided by circumstances,
but several broad rules may be laid down. All
have one end, but the order may be varied. That
is best which is readiest, the grand rule being to
lose no time. Most of the modes of treatment
come under one or other of the three following
heads:&mdash;1. <span class="smcap">Get rid of the poison.</span> 2. <span class="smcap">Stop its
action.</span> 3. <span class="smcap">Remedy the mischief it has done.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>To get rid of the poison</i> is ordinarily the first
thing to be done, but not always. To do so when
the poison has been swallowed two means may be
employed: <i>vomiting</i> or the <i>stomach-pump</i>.</p>

<p>The latter is one of the most certain means we
possess of emptying the stomach; and by means
of it this viscus may be washed out, and the antidote,
if any be known, administered. In speaking
hereafter, however, of the treatment to be
adopted in each particular instance it will be seen
that there are some cases, as poisoning by corrosives,
in which this instrument cannot be used;
as it might not only cause laceration of the tissues,
but even perforation of the œsophagus or stomach.
It is hardly necessary to mention that in all cases
a certain tact is required in its employment; the
tube having, on more than one occasion, been
introduced into the trachea, and the lungs injected
with water, &amp;c. It is a good rule also to withdraw
less fluid than is pumped into the stomach.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Supposing, however, that this instrument is not
at hand, or that it is an improper occasion for its
employment, recourse must be had to vomiting,
natural or artificial. Vomiting is, in many instances,
one of the first and most important signs
of poisoning, especially by irritant substances.
When such is the case, it is only necessary to foster
the tendency by copious draughts of lukewarm
water; but if there be no vomiting and the
stomach pump be not at hand an emetic must be
given. Of these remedies perhaps there is not one
which can be generally used with so much advantage
as the sulphate of zinc in scruple doses; for not
only is it more rapid in its action, but its effects
are less depressing than those of any others.
This last recommendation will appear the more
desirable when we remember that the absorption
of poisons is promoted by all lowering measures;
and consequently, bleeding, the exhibition of tartarised
antimony, and the administration of drastic
purgatives, ought to be avoided. In poisoning by
opium and other narcotics, the sulphate of copper
in eight or ten grain doses will often excite the
stomach to act when other emetics have failed.
Ipecacuan wine (six or eight drachms) is a useful
agent in many cases; or if a warm stimulating
draught be needed a scruple of powdered ipecacuanha,
with the same quantity of the sesquicarbonate
of ammonia, may be administered in a
wineglassful of water. In the absence of these,
mustard proves an excellent substitute; a teaspoonful
or two being given in warm water, and
frequently repeated. Even common salt may be
used with good effect. Vomiting may also be excited
by tickling the fauces, as well as by the free
administration of warm water or of hot greasy
water.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>When the poison has been applied locally</i>, to prevent
its absorption, a ligature must be applied between
the trunk and the wounded part, as near the latter
as possible; while the deleterious substance is to
be removed by free incisions and plentiful washings.
Sucking by the mouth or by cupping-glasses
may also be employed.</p>

<p>2. <i>To stop the action of the poison if it cannot be
readily and immediately removed.</i>&mdash;The means whereby
this is effected is ordinarily the administration
of an antidote. As no universal antidote is known,
the treatment will of course vary with the substance
taken. This will be fully explained when
speaking of each particular poison.</p>

<p>An antidote, according to Orfila, should possess
the following properties:&mdash;It should be capable of
being taken in a large dose without danger; it
should act upon the poison, whether liquid or solid,
at a temperature equal to or below that of the
body; its action should be quick; it should be capable
of combining with the poison, though shielded
by the gastric juice, mucus, bile, or other substances
contained in the stomach; and lastly, it
should deprive the poison of its deleterious properties.</p>

<p>Antidotes mostly operate by forming harmless
chemical combinations, or by producing insoluble
compounds, and thus preventing or delaying absorption.
In most cases they have no effect upon
the constitution; but some may be looked upon as
a kind of counter-poison. Thus, the antagonistic
action of opium and belladonna seems fairly made
out, and we might perhaps include under this
head chloroform, as in some degree, an antidote
to strychnia.</p>

<p>Dr. Garrod has described a series of experiments
in which he employed purified animal charcoal as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
an antidote. Dogs, rabbits, and guinea-pigs were
the animals experimented on; while the poisons
consisted of large doses of opium, belladonna,
aconite, nux vomica, arsenic, and other drugs.
They were given without mischief when sufficient
animal charcoal was administered simultaneously,
or, in some instances, before the peculiar effects of
the destructive drug were developed. This substance
seems to act in a great measure mechanically,
but it has also a power of absorbing alkaloids
which may render it useful. Such substances as
magnesia and gruel are sometimes given with the
view of protecting the walls of the stomach, with
doubtful benefit.</p>

<p>3. <i>To remedy the mischief done, and obviate the tendency
to death.</i>&mdash;Unfortunately, in a great number
of instances, too long an interval has elapsed between
the exhibition of the poison and the time
when the first-mentioned indications can be fully
carried into effect; for, as before implied, if
absorption has taken place, direct antidotes will
be of little avail.</p>

<p>Our object must then be to palliate the symptoms
as they arise, as well as to neutralize the <i>effects</i> of
the poison on the constitution, by remedies of an
opposite character. Thus in poisoning by depressing
agents and narcotics, or such as destroy
the nervous force, all lowering measures must be
avoided, and agents used which will exert a contrary
effect, as stimulants, cold effusion, galvanism
&amp;c. The shock to the nervous system must also
be taken account, and appropriate remedies employed
to aid it in rallying.</p>

<p>Thus direct injection of liquid ammonia into the
veins has been found successful in the treatment
of snake bite in Australia, by Professor Halford
and others.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Claude Bernard has shown the importance of
particularly attending to the way in which the poison
destroys life. For example, curare paralyzes the
motor nerves, puts a stop to all motion, suspends
respiration, and so brings on suffocation; yet by
keeping up artificial respiration for a sufficient
length of time, life may be preserved till the poison
is eliminated and the danger over. Strychnia attacks
the sensitive portion of the nervous system;
but if the external excitement, which perpetually
provokes reflex action and thereby brings on fatal
convulsions, be guarded against, recovery may
ensue. A frog, poisoned by strychnia, rapidly
dies if frequently excited; whereas left perfectly
quiet under a bell-glass, it will, cæteris paribus,
recover.</p>

<p>Lastly, we must endeavor to promote the elimination
of the poison from the body, by exciting the
excreting functions; for which purpose, in poisoning
by arsenic, after the stomach has been well
emptied, Orfila has proposed the employment of
diuretics, because it has been found that this
poison, like most others, is carried off in large
quantities by the urine.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>DETECTION OF POISONS.</h3>

<p class="p2">The detection of a poison is, in many instances,
no easy matter; it should not therefore be rashly
undertaken, except by one well skilled in the
minutiæ of the processes to be adopted; but on
the other hand, there are so many points of prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>tical
importance which may be noted by the
practitioner in charge, that his attention should
be specially directed to these. The exact determination
of the cause of death will depend partly
on the symptoms noted during life and on the
appearances found after death. These come within
the province of the ordinary practitioner; on
the other hand, the special physical, chemical and
physiological portion of the inquiry should be referred
to the expert. In a book of this scope it is
impossible to give full details with regard to these
last, but a brief sketch nay be useful.</p>

<p>The physical examination, say of the contents
of the stomach and intestines, should commence
with noting the smell, color, and general appearance
of the matters submitted for examination.
The odor, for instance, may be useful in indicating
the presence of prussic acid, of alcohol, of opium,
or of phosphorus. The color may indicate the
presence of salts of copper, of fragments of cantharides,
&amp;c. The general appearance may give some
clue to the mode of introducing the poison, the
kind of food or drink used to conceal it, &amp;c. Seeds
of poisonous plants may be found: this is especially
the case in India, where the seeds of datura are
frequently used for criminal purposes; or the poisonous
substance may have been administered in
such quantity that a portion of it may at once be
secured for analysis. This not unfrequently happens
in poisoning by arsenic. It is not enough to
employ the naked eye in examining these suspected
matters; a hand lens of some power should be
used; in this way characteristic crystalline forms,
botanical peculiarities, and such like, may be
made out.</p>

<p>Still these are merely introductory to the most
important part of the research, which ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
undertaken systematically, especially if the quantity
of material to be operated on is small. Most
frequently the matters to be examined are mixed,
some soluble, some insoluble; but there may also
be submitted for analysis portions of the pure
substance. The object of the analyst is to obtain
the substances which he has to examine chemically
in as pure a condition as possible, so that there
may be no doubt about the results of his testing;
also, of course, to separate active substances from
those that are inert, all being mixed together in
the stomach and alimentary canal. Again, in
dealing with such fluids as the blood, or the tissues
of the body, their natural constituents must
be got rid of before the foreign and poisonous
body can be reached. There is this difficulty further
to contend with: that some of the most poisonous
of substances are of unstable composition and
readily altered by chemical reagents; to this group
belong many vegetable and most animal poisons.
These, therefore, must be treated differently from
the more stable inorganic compounds. With an
inorganic poison we may destroy all organic
materials mixed with it, trusting to find it still recognizable
after the process; not so with an organic
substance: that must be separated by other than
destructive means.</p>

<p>When the mixture submitted for examination
consists of bodies perfectly soluble and perfectly
insoluble, simple filtration may suffice to secure
their separation; but this is rarely the case, some
colloidal material being ordinarily mixed with the
crystalloid, and the plan of separating them by
<i>dialysis</i>, as proposed by Graham, not being altogether
successful. When the substances looked
for are volatile, distillation may be employed to secure
them in a state of purity; in this way prussic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
acid is separated; but in the case of the poisonous
alkaloids other means must be adopted.</p>

<p>I. In the separation of such an alkaloid as
strychnia, for example, the suspected material is
first of all acidulated by one of the weaker mineral
or stronger vegetable acids (hydrochloric
acid is best), and the whole carefully heated over
a water bath. After a time this mixture is to be
filtered, and the filtrate well washed with boiling
distilled water, and the filtered fluid subjected to
evaporation. When dry the substance is to be
rubbed up with distilled water, and again filtered;
this process to be repeated until a tolerably pure
product be obtained. This is next to be neutralized
by hydrogen sodium carbonate, or bicarbonate
of soda, and the freed alkaloid taken up by rubbing
or shaking it with chloroform or ether, and
the whole set aside in a well-corked tall test tube.
Finally, the ether or chloroform containing the alkaloid
is to be removed by a pipette and allowed
to evaporate spontaneously, when the alkaloid
will probably be left behind in a state fit for testing.
This process is a modification of that invented by
Stas, in following out the case of the Count
Bocarmé.</p>

<p>II. For the destruction of organic matter in the
search for an inorganic poison, such as arsenic, a
process introduced by Fresenius and Von Babo
is commonly employed. Its essentials are as
follows: The organic matter is to be reduced to as
fine shreds as possible, and mixed with about one-eighth
of its bulk of pure hydrochloric acid. This is
to be heated, and, as it boils, from time to time crystals
of potassic chlorate are added, until the solids
are reduced to a straw-yellow fluid. This is next
treated with hydrogen sodium sulphite, or bisul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>phate
of soda, until a distinct smell of sulphurous
acid is given off, after which sulphuretted
hydrogen is to be passed through the fluid, concentrated
if necessary, for some hours, thus throwing
down most metallic poisons in the form of
sulphide. This precipitate is to be collected and
further tested.</p>

<p>When exceedingly small quantities are dealt with
the microscope is of use, and the plan of subliming
alkaloids and examining their crystals under the
microscope, introduced by Guy and Helwig, will
be found very useful. The shape of crystalline
poisons is a valuable means of determining their
identity; arsenic and antimony may thus be readily
distinguished, as may other well known substances.</p>

<p>The spectrum has not yet been applied to toxicological
research, although it has been employed
to determine the existence of a blood stain.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF POISONS.</h3>

<p class="p2">There is nothing more difficult in toxicology
than to give a satisfactory classification of poisons,
insomuch that some have fallen back on the
no-classification, or natural history system, and
grouped poisons as mineral, vegetable, and animal,
according to their source. In despair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
achieving anything better, a modification of the
old and well-known system is here followed, poisons
being classed as Corrosives, Irritants (Simple
and Specific), and Neurotics; the latter group is,
however, further subdivided, something in the same
way as that adopted by Dr. Guy. The group of
corrosives should comprehend all which by contact
destroy the bodily textures, and so occasion death.
These same substances, when diluted, may be incapable
of destroying the tissues directly, but may
do so by setting up inflammation; these with certain
others having like effects, would form the group
of simple irritants. They kill by virtue of their
secondary effects on the constitution. But some
substances, like arsenic, are not only capable of
inducing local inflammations, with their secondary
effects, but are also possessed of certain specific
and well marked properties differing in each case.
These are <i>specific irritants</i>.</p>

<p>Neurotics comprehend all poisons whose effects
are mostly referable to the nervous system, necessarily
a most diverse group, which we are not yet
in a position to minutely analyze. Some, however,
act mainly on the brain, some on the spinal cord,
some on certain nerves only, or on the vasomotor
system of nerves; some act it is hardly possible
to tell how.</p>

<p>There was an old group of <i>septic</i> poisons; to this
might still be referred certain noxious gases, such
as sulphuretted hydrogen; or were it made to include
all poisons acting directly on the blood, it
would include the still more dangerous gas, carbonic
oxide.</p>

<p><i>Irritant</i> poisons give rise to pain in the stomach
and bowels, faintness and sickness, and purging
with tenesmus. The evacuations are often tinged
with blood, the pulse is feeble and irregular, and
the skin cold. Many of the substances of this class
from irritating the tissues with which they come in
contact, produce a severe burning sensation in the
mouth and œsophagus, as well as in the stomach.
The degree of local destructive action produced
will of course vary in proportion to the amount of
the vehicle with which the noxious agent may be
diluted. Irritants cause death by inducing collapse
or convulsions, or by exciting severe inflammation;
or, after a variable interval, by leading
to stricture of the œsophagus. The diseases
which most resemble the action of irritants are,
malignant cholera, severe diarrhœa, colic, gastritis,
enteritis, rupture of the stomach or intestines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
obstruction of the bowels, mechanical or otherwise.</p>

<p>The symptoms of apoplexy, epilepsy, and uræmia
bear a resemblance to those caused by some of the
poisons of the neurotic class. Others give rise to
delirum with spectral illusions or convulsions.
Sometimes there is tetanus, sometimes coma or
syncope. Diseases of the brain and spinal cord,
likely to be confounded with these, are often very
insidious in their progress, and hence may suddenly
give rise to suspicious symptoms. The history,
mode of attack, &amp;c., will generally negative
any suspicion of poisoning.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CONCENTRATED MINERAL ACIDS.</h3>

<p class="p2">The first division of the Corrosive consists of
the Strong Mineral Acids. In this chapter we
have to review the effects, &amp;c., of the acids commonly
encountered, which are Sulphuric Acid,
Nitric Acid, Hydrochloric Acid, or a mixture of
two or more of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphuric Acid</span> (<i>Oil of Vitriol</i>).&mdash;This heavy,
oily looking liquid is met with in two states, concentrated
and diluted; and being extensively employed
in commerce and manufactures is much
more frequently used as a poison than the other
mineral acids. Many infants and young children
have been poisoned by it; occasionally also men,
under the influence of drink. The acid is not unfrequently
thrown over the person, either to disfigure
the features or to destroy the clothes. The
parts of the body with which it is brought into
contact are stained at first of a white, and afterwards
of a dark brown or black color. The
smallest fatal dose of concentrated acid recorded,
in the adult, is one drachm; but recovery has taken
place after as much as two ounces. But it must be
understood that the acid proves fatal mainly by its
power of corrosion, so that a small dose of the concentrated
acid is more dangerous than is a much
larger dose of it in the dilute form. The average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
period at which death occurs is from sixteen to
twenty-four hours; but on the other hand, death
may not occur for months, and may only follow
the organic changes induced by cicatrization following
the swallowing of the acid, or the malnutrition
following its destructive action on the coats
of the stomach.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;It is not within the province of these
Memoranda to treat of the various processes by
which poisons are to be detected; for to make a
trustworthy analysis requires the skill of a professed
chemist, whose assistance should be allowed
in these medico-legal investigations. Where the
character of a dead man or the life of a supposed
criminal is at stake there must be no chance of
error. The ordinary tests will, however, be briefly
described, if only to help the physician to treat
the case more satisfactorily than he could do by
merely guessing that an irritant or narcotic had
been employed:</p>

<p>Concentrated sulphuric acid is usually a brownish
colored liquid, which chars or corrodes wood
or other organic matter brought into contact with
it, and when mixed with water gives out heat.
When diluted, its presence may be thus detected:</p>

<p>1. The liquid is known to be acid by its action
on litmus paper.</p>

<p>2. Add to a portion of the suspected liquid a few
drops of nitric acid, and then a solution of nitrate
of barium; a white precipitate (sulphate of barium)
will fall if sulphuric acid be present. This test is
extremely delicate; for although other acids yield
a precipitate on the addition of nitrate of barium,
yet as such deposits are all soluble in nitric acid
the previous addition of this acid will prevent
their formation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The precipitate should next be collected,
dried, and reduced with charcoal by the blow-pipe
flame to the condition of barium sulphide. This,
when treated with a drop of hydrochloric acid,
gives off sulphuretted hydrogen, known by blackening
paper dipped in acetate of lead solution.</p>

<p>To examine a piece of cloth stained with this
poison it is only necessary to boil it in distilled
water and then apply to the liquid the barium test
as before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nitric Acid</span> (<i>Aqua fortis</i>, <i>Red Spirit of Nitre</i>).&mdash;This
substance has been employed as a poison for
upwards of four centuries. Like the oil of vitriol
it is found in commerce in a concentrated and in a
diluted state. Cases of poisoning by it are rare.
It produces a yellow stain on the skin. Two
drachms is the smallest quantity which has destroyed
life; but less than this would probably prove
fatal, if it produced much corrosion about the
wind-pipe. Death has occurred from it, in one
hour and three quarters; the average would be
within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Several cases ending fatally have followed the
inhalation of the fumes of this acid, probably by
inducing very extensive inflammation of the lung.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;The concentrated acid may be known
by its orange-colored irritating fumes, and by its
action on copper, tin, or mercury.</p>

<p>1. When poured on copper-filings, effervescence
takes place, a red acid vapor is given off, and a
green liquid remains (solution of nitrate of copper).</p>

<p>2. In a diluted state it is detected by its acid
reaction; by no precipitate being obtained by
nitrate of barium or by nitrate of silver, proving
the absence of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids;
further, by neutralizing the liquid with potass,
evaporating it, and then procuring crystals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
nitrate of potassium, in the form of lengthened
fluted prisms, which are permanent in the air.
These crystals may be powdered and moistened
with strong sulphuric acid, when a colorless acid
vapor (nitric acid) will be evolved. Or the powdered
crystals may be mixed with an equal bulk
of fine copper filings, moistened with water, and
treated with a few drops of sulphuric acid; when
ruddy acid fumes will be given off.</p>

<p>3. Other tests for nitric acid are, (<i>a</i>,) its action
on morphia, which it turns red: (<i>b</i>,) its action on
green iron sulphate, which it blackens; (<i>c</i>,) a trace
of it along with sulphuric acid gives with narcotine
a blood red color; and finally, (<i>d</i>,) along with
hydrochloric acid it dissolves gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrochloric Acid</span> (<i>Muriatic Acid</i>, <i>Spirit of Salt</i>).&mdash;Not
more than half a dozen cases of poisoning
by this acid have occurred in the last fifteen or
twenty years in this country. In May, 1859, a
woman sixty-three years old was admitted into
King’s College Hospital within three-quarters of an
hour of swallowing half an ounce of the strong
acid. She had burning pain in the throat and
stomach, vomiting of brown shreddy matters, and
great prostration. Death occurred in eighteen
hours, from the corrosive action of the poison.
This is the smallest dose which has been known
to prove fatal.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;The concentrated hydrochloric acid of
commerce is of a yellowish color, it fumes in the
air when strong, and produces dense white fumes
with the vapor of ammonia.</p>

<p>1. It may be identified by boiling with black
oxide of manganese; chlorine being given off,
which is known by its odor, color, and bleaching
properties.</p>

<p>2. When diluted, its presence is ascertained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nitrate of silver causing a dense white precipitate
(chloride of silver). The chloride is distinguished
from other salts of silver by (<i>a</i>,) its insolubility in
nitric acid, and in caustic potass; (<i>b</i>,) by its being
soluble in ammonia; (<i>c</i>,) by its melting and forming
a horny mass when dried and heated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mixed Acids.</span>&mdash;These acids being used for commercial
purposes when mixed&mdash;<i>the nitro-muriatic</i>
(aqua regia) to dissolve gold, and the <i>nitro-sulphuric</i>
(aqua reginæ) to dissolve silver&mdash;might occasion
their being employed as poisons. <i>Sulphate
of indigo</i>, which consists of a solution of indigo
in strong sulphuric acid, has proved fatal in cases
where it has been accidentally taken.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms, Treatment, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The <i>symptoms</i> produced
by the mineral acids are much the same in
all cases. There is violent, burning pain in the
mouth, œsophagus, and stomach, commencing <i>immediately</i>.
The burning is followed by retching
and vomiting of a dark colored liquid with shreds
of mucus, and portions of the mucous membrane
of the œsophagus or stomach. The inside of the
mouth is shrivelled and more or less corroded unless
the agent has been given in a spoon or otherwise
passed over the tongue to the back of the
fauces. The outside of the lips and mouth will
probably present the stains characteristic of the
acid used. There is great thirst, difficulty of swallowing,
and impeded respiration. The bowels are
confined; the urine scanty or suppressed. Next
succeeds great exhaustion, the pulse becomes quick
and feeble, and the skin gets cold and clammy.
The countenance is anxious and expressive of great
suffering; death speedily occurs, the intellectual
faculties remaining clear to the last.</p>

<p>These acids may prove fatal without entering
the stomach by causing asphyxia, the chink of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
glottis becoming closed by swelling of the fauces,
&amp;c. They have sometimes been administered by
the vagina, rectum, &amp;c., and been poured into the
ear during sleep.</p>

<p>Where recovery takes place from their immediate
effects there is always fear of death resulting at
the end of one or two years from stricture of the
œsophagus, and even at an earlier period, unless
proper treatment is adopted. Occasionally one of
the secondary effects of sulphuric acid has been
profuse salivation.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem appearances</i> are the following:
The body may have a healthy appearance. Usually
there are stains about the mouth, fingers, and
wherever the cuticle has been reached by the acid.
The inner surface of the mouth, fauces, and
œsophagus, is usually white and corroded, or
dark brown and shrivelled, the mucous coat being
easily detached. The epiglottis and glottis are
usually swollen. The gullet resembles the mouth
in most respects. The outer surface of the stomach
and intestines is very vascular, that of the
former being sometimes corroded and occasionally
perforated. The stomach is sometimes contracted,
sometimes distended with gas, and contains a
thick, dark brown fluid; its inner surface has a
charred, blackened appearance, the mucous membrane
between the rugæ being of a scarlet hue.
The pylorus is mostly contracted; while the inner
coat of the duodenum and small intestines presents
a similar appearance, in a less degree, to that of
the stomach. When perforation occurs it usually
takes place posteriorly, and the edges of the rent
are softened. The escaped matters may have acted
on the adjacent viscera.</p>

<p>According to Casper, after poisoning by sulphuric
acid the bodies resist putrefaction for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
some time, owing perhaps to the acid neutralizing
the ammonia of decomposition. It may be the
same with the other mineral acids.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Bicarbonate of soda, or calcined
magnesia, or the carbonate of magnesia, should be
immediately given, mixed in milk or any mucilaginous
fluid; the doses being continued at short intervals,
until it may be inferred that the acid is
neutralized. In the absence of these remedies
substitutes may be found in chalk, whiting, soap
and water, or the plaster of the apartment beaten
up with water. Oleaginous and mucilaginous
fluids, as olive oil, linseed tea, barley water, milk
gruel, &amp;c., may be freely given, either alone, or as
the vehicles of the antidote. The success of this
treatment will depend upon the promptitude with
which it is adopted.</p>

<p>The stomach pump should not be employed;
the disorganized and softened state of the gullet
and stomach, rendering them excessively liable to
perforation.</p>

<p>Should the larynx be affected and the breathing
impeded, tracheotomy must be at once had recourse
to.</p>

<p>After a sufficiency of the antidote has been
given the use of mucilaginous diluents must be
continued for some time, and the subsequent
treatment will be that for gastro-enteritis. Great
benefit will be derived from the use of oily
enemata.</p>

<p>The external parts which have been injured by
the acid should be well bathed with soap and
water, and treated like burns.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE CORROSIVE VEGETABLE ACIDS.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Oxalic Acid</span> (<i>Acid of Sugar</i>).&mdash;This is one of the
most important poisons with which we have to
deal. From its cheapness and well-known properties
it is frequently made use of in cases of suicide,
while from its resemblance to Epsom salts it has
on several occasions been taken in mistake for
that medicine. The smallest dose which is known
to have proved fatal is one drachm, which killed a
boy æt. sixteen in eight hours. Taylor relates the
case of a woman, aged twenty-eight, who was found
dead one hour after swallowing three drachms of
the crystallized acid. Christison mentions an instance
in which one ounce destroyed life in ten
minutes, and another case where the same quantity
killed a girl in thirty minutes. One example has
been recorded where a fatal result ensued probably
within three minutes of the acid being
swallowed.</p>

<p>The poisonous properties of the <i>Binoxalate of
Potash</i> (Salt of Sorrel, Essential Salt of Lemons)
are due to the oxalic acid it contains. This salt,
which exists in the leaves of the wood sorrel
(Oxalis acetosella), is sold to bleach straw, remove
ink-stains, &amp;c. It is very cheap; is almost as
powerful as oxalic acid itself, and gives rise to the
same kind of symptoms; it has been taken for the
purpose of suicide, as well as in mistake for the
bitartrate of potash, or cream of tartar.</p>

<p>Oxalate of lime exists in considerable quantity
in the leaves and stalks of the common edible
rhubarb (Rheum Rhaponticum). It can hardly be
considered poisonous.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The effects of poisoning by oxalic
acid are peculiar. When the dose is large (half an
ounce or more) and the solution concentrated, it
proves very rapidly fatal. It produces a hot burning
sensation in the fauces and œsophagus in the
act of swallowing, severe burning pain in the
stomach, and in most instances immediate vomiting.
The vomited matters are strongly acid, of a
dirty green or black color, and consist of the
contents of the stomach with altered mucus and
blood. The remaining symptoms are a sense of
constriction or suffocation, lividity of the countenance,
great prostration of strength, feeble pulse,
cold clammy perspirations, and convulsions, which
speedily terminate in death. When a smaller
quantity has been taken, much diluted, its corrosive
properties are weakened or destroyed, but
the nervous symptoms, as cramps and numbness,
may be well marked.</p>

<p>In cases of recovery the mouth may remain sore
for some time, the tongue swollen, the abdomen
tender, the stomach very irritable, and there may
be troublesome diarrhœa. In two instances there
has been loss of voice for several days, owing to
the action of the poison on the nervous system.
Twitching of the muscles of the face and extremities
has also been observed.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The mucous membrane
of the fauces, œsophagus, and stomach is
generally white and brittle, but often colored with
the brown mucous matter discharged. The stomach
often contains a black fluid, like coffee-grounds,
consisting principally of altered blood; and its sub-mucous
coats are vascular and dark colored. The
stomach though seldom perforated, may yet be so
softened as to be with difficulty removed entire,
and sometimes this is not possible. This soften<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ing
may be due to the post-mortem action of the
poison; but its effects during life in softening and
bleaching the mucous membrane are sufficiently
marked. Occasionally the stomach is black and
gangrenous looking. If death has occurred quickly,
the small intestines are seldom much affected; but
where the symptoms have been protracted there
are usually signs of congestion and inflammation.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Chalk, whiting, or magnesia, suspended
in water, or in some demulcent fluid,
must be administered immediately; and if necessary,
vomiting should be excited by tickling the
fauces, or administering emetics of sulphate of zinc
and ipecacuan, followed by large quantities of emollient
drinks. The antidote, to be effective, must
be given as soon as possible, the plaster of the
apartment, or any form of mortar being used in the
absence of the remedies just mentioned. Alkalies
(soda, potash, or their carbonates) are not only
useless, but they form salts with oxalic acid, which
are as injurious as the acid itself. When there
are symptoms of collapse, stimulants are to be
freely employed.</p>

<p>From the tendency to softening, the stomach-pump
should not be used.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;Crystals of oxalic acid are met with as
four-sided prisms, colorless, without odor permanent
in the air, and very acid; this last character
distinguishing them from crystals of sulphate
of magnesia and sulphate of zinc. The crystals,
when heated, melt, and are dissipated without
combustion, and leaving no residue. This character
is important as a means of distinguishing
oxalic acid from other similar crystals. They are
soluble in from eight to twelve parts of cold water.
This acid may be thus recognised in solution:</p>

<p>1. <i>Nitrate of silver</i> throws down, with oxalic acid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
an abundant white precipitate (oxalate of silver),
which is soluble in nitric acid. The oxalate of
silver, when dried and heated on platinum foil,
detonates, and is dissipated in a white vapor.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sulphate of calcium</i> causes a white precipitate
with oxalic acid (oxalate of calcium) which is
soluble in nitric or hydrochloric, but not in any
vegetable acid.</p>

<p>The solution containing the acid should be concentrated
before testing, if it be not present in
considerable quantity.</p>

<p>Lime water and all soluble lime salts throw
down precipitates with oxalic acid; but as these
are liable to be mistaken for a precipitate with
sulphuric acid, it is better to use sulphate of
calcium which is slightly soluble, as the test agent.
A good deal of the test solution must be used, and
the precipitate takes time to settle.</p>

<p>3. <i>Sulphate of copper</i> gives a faint bluish precipitate
with oxalic acid (oxalate of copper), which is
not redissolved by a few drops of hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p>These tests will not act if the solution contain
nitric acid in excess, in which case the liquid
must be evaporated to crystallization, and the
crystals washed and redissolved in water.</p>

<p>These tests for oxalic acid should never be applied
without previously separating it from all organic
matter. This is best done by first of all acidulating
the suspected fluid with acetic acid, and
then adding acetate of lead, which combines with
the oxalic acid to form a white insoluble salt, which
may ordinarily be removed by filtration or subsidence.
This filtrate, after being well washed, is
to be diffused in water, and into this a current of
sulphuretted hydrogen gas is to be passed for some
considerable time. This will throw down the lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
as sulphide, leaving the oxalic acid in the fluid;
any organic matter will also be carried down.
Filtration will separate the solids from the liquid
containing the acid, which may now be evaporated
until crystals are formed, which may be tested in
the usual way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acetic Acid.</span>&mdash;Although this acid, in its concentrated
state, is highly corrosive, yet it is very
seldom brought under the notice of the toxicologist.</p>

<p>In the case of a young woman reported by Orfila,
death quickly occurred after several attacks of
convulsions. At the subsequent post-mortem examination,
the integuments of the dependent parts
of the body were found very livid; the tongue and
œsophagus were of a dirty brown color, the latter
being intersected by a fine net-work of capillary
vessels; and the interior of the stomach was interspersed
with black elevations caused by the
presence of coagulated blood in the sub-mucous
areolar tissue. The mucous membrane was
entire.</p>

<p>As regards the <i>treatment</i>, it is only necessary to
administer draughts containing magnesia or its
carbonate, followed by mucilaginous or demulcent
drinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tartaric Acid</span>, though not a corrosive, may be
here placed along with the other vegetable acids.
Strange as it may seem, tartaric acid has destroyed
life in at least one instance in this country; an
ounce having been given in mistake for an aperient
salt. The deceased swallowed the whole at
once, and immediately called out that he had been
poisoned. He complained of intense pain in the
throat and stomach, as if he had swallowed oil of
vitriol, or was on fire. Soda and magnesia were
administered without avail; and after death, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the end of nine days’ suffering, the stomach and
intestines were found much inflamed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE CAUSTIC ALKALIES AND THEIR CARBONATES;
POTASH, SODA, AMMONIA.</h3>

<p class="p2">The second division of the class of Corrosives
has now to be considered. It contains the Caustic
Alkalies, and some of their Salts. Poisoning by
any of these agents is rare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potash.</span>&mdash;This substance, in its caustic state, as
found in commerce, is in the form of grey-colored
cakes. It has an acrid taste, is soapy to the touch,
and very deliquescent. Moulded in cylinders, it is
often employed as a caustic (Potassa fusa). In
solution (Liquor potassæ) it is strongly alkaline,
and imparts a brown stain to black cloth.</p>

<p><i>Potassium carbonate</i> or <i>Carbonate of Potash</i> (Pearlash)
is extensively used by laundresses and in the
dressing of woollen cloth. It is generally sold in a
granular condition, white, inodorous, and strongly
alkaline; it is soluble in water, but not in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caustic Soda.</span>&mdash;This agent resembles potash in
its general properties. The <i>Sodium Carbonate</i> or
<i>Carbonate of Soda</i> (Soap-lees) bears a similar resemblance
to the carbonate of potash, except that
it crystallizes easily, and effloresces on exposure to
the air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ammonia.</span>&mdash;When pure, ammonia is a colorless,
pungent gas; but it is commonly met with dissolved
in water, as the liquor ammoniæ. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
vapor is poisonous, and may prove fatal by producing
inflammation of the larynx and trachea,
and even of the lungs. A case is recorded of a
French boy, æt. six, who killed his younger sister
by making her swallow several teaspoonfuls of a
solution of ammonia. Other instances have also occurred
where the liquor ammoniæ has either been
taken in mistake for the aromatic spirit of ammoniæ,
or purposely, to destroy life. An instance is recorded
by Dr. Taylor, as occurring in the practice of Mr.
Hilton, where liquor ammoniæ, given by mistake,
caused corrosion of the throat and gullet and obstruction
of the bronchial tubes by false membrane.
The œsophagus was completely dissolved
at its junction with the stomach, and there was
an aperture in the anterior wall of that organ such
as might have been caused by oil of vitriol.</p>

<p>The <i>Ammonium Carbonate</i> or <i>Carbonate of Ammonia</i>
(Hartshorn, Smelling Salts) has been used
as a poison. It may be distinguished from other
salts by its being alkaline, by its entire volatility,
and by its pungent odor. A young woman in a
state of unconsciousness, was made to swallow a
quantity of hartshorn. In an hour there was great
pain, sickness, and vomiting of blood. The hæmatemesis
continued for some days, and then feebleness
and emaciation set in, death occurring in
three months. On examination the pylorus was
found contracted to the size of a crow-quill, while
there was a large cicatrix on the posterior wall of
the stomach.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The chief symptoms occasioned by
the foregoing poisons are, an acrid, burning taste,
with a sensation of excoriation and burning extending
along the mouth and throat, to the stomach.
There soon ensue exquisite pain in the
epigastrium, and tenderness on pressure. Fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>quently
there is cough, hoarseness, dyspnœa, as
well as vomiting of altered mucus mixed with
blood and detached portions of the mucous membrane.
The tongue, mouth, and fauces become
swollen, soft, and flabby, and deglutition is difficult.
The surface of the body gets cold and moist,
the pulse small and feeble, and there is great pain
over the abdomen, with diarrhœa. Death took
place, in the case of a boy, in three hours from
the time of swallowing a strong solution of carbonate
of potash. Ammonia, by its effect on the
air passages, has proved fatal in four minutes.
When recovery from the immediate effects of the
poison has taken place, death has subsequently
ensued from stricture of the œsophagus, producing
starvation. By the proper use of bougies, &amp;c., life
may occasionally be prolonged for many months,
or even for years. In some instances, however, it
is almost impossible to effect dilatation, owing to
the whole of the gullet becoming thickened and
contracted, so that the opening into the stomach
will hardly admit a crow-quill. The pylorus may
also be contracted in like manner.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The mucous membrane
of the mouth and gullet is softened and inflamed,
and portions of it detached. The coats of
the stomach and intestines are inflamed, stained
of a dark color, and sometimes ulcerated. When
death has resulted from ammonia, signs of inflammation
are usually found in the larynx and bronchial
tubes. The other caustic alkalies may also
destroy life by producing inflammation of the
glottis, which consequently may be found thus
occluded after death.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The object must be to neutralize the
poison, which may be effected by a weak acid.
Vinegar and water is perhaps the best antidote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and that most readily procurable; its administration
may be followed up by freely allowing acidulated
demulcent drinks, orange juice, &amp;c. The
use of oil has been recommended, on the principle
that it converts the alkali into a soap. But that
its efficacy is doubtful has been in some measure
shown by the death of two young children from
swallowing a mixture of ammonia and oil. In one
of these cases nearly two ounces of linimentum
ammoniæ (made of one part of liquor ammonia to
two of olive oil) were poured down an infant’s
throat by a child five years old. Were, however,
the oil given in much greater abundance, the result
would probably be different. At all events,
its administration should not be neglected.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;The specific character of these substances
is their strongly marked alkalinity, ammonia possessing,
over and above, that of volatility. Potash
is known from soda by being precipitated of a
creamy yellow by platinum perchloride, soda remaining
unaffected by that reagent.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<h3>SALTS OF THE ALKALIES AND ALKALINE EARTHS.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Potassium Nitrate</span> or <span class="smcap">Nitrate of Potash</span>
(<i>Nitre</i>, <i>Saltpetre</i>, <i>Salprunelle</i>) is a more dangerous
poison than is commonly supposed, provided the
dose be large. It has ordinarily been given in
mistake for other salts as a purgative, and in one
instance, caused death in about two hours, in another
such instance, referred to by Orfila, an
ounce proved fatal in three hours. It produces
symptoms of irritation in the alimentary canal,
vomiting, and diarrhœa. There is generally also
severe pain at the pit of the stomach, trembling
of the limbs, scanty urine, and collapse. Marks
of violent inflammation are found after death in
the stomach and along the intestinal canal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potassium Sulphate</span> or <span class="smcap">Sulphate of Potash</span>
(<i>Sal Polychrest</i>, <i>Sal de Duobus</i>, &amp;c.) has proved
fatal when taken in a large dose. It has caused
death in two or three cases when purposely administered
to procure abortion. Taylor quotes
an instance of a lady, a week after delivery, being
directed by her medical attendant to take ten
drachms of this salt, in divided doses as a laxative.
After the first dose she was seized with severe
pain in the stomach, with vomiting, &amp;c., the symptoms
increasing after each dose, and proving fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in two hours. At the post-mortem examination
the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines
was seen to be soft and pale, and the stomach
contained a quantity of reddish-colored liquid.
This, on being analyzed, was found to contain no
other irritant but this salt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bitartrate of Potass</span> or <span class="smcap">Hydrogen Potassium
Tartrate</span> (<i>Cream of Tartar</i>, <i>Argol</i>.)&mdash;This salt has
caused death in one case at least, in which about
an ounce and a half was taken. The symptoms
were those of an irritant poison, with paralysis of
the lower extremities. Death occurred within
forty-eight hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphuret of Potassium</span> (<i>Liver of Sulphur</i>) has
also caused death as an irritant poison.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;As no antidotes are known to these
salts the treatment must consist in producing
vomiting as speedily as possible by means of
emetics; or the stomach-pump may be used. Demulcent
drinks should be freely given subsequently,
with soothing applications to the bowels. Ice
may be given in any quantity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lime</span> acts as an irritant poison, though a feeble
one, when taken into the stomach or applied to a
vital part. One fatal instance is reported, where
a boy swallowed some lime in an apple-pie. He
died in nine days, after suffering from a burning
pain in the abdomen, great thirst, and obstinate
constipation. Unslaked or imperfectly slaked
lime may also prove fatal by being inhaled, and
so giving rise to inflammation of the glottis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barium Salts.</span>&mdash;Two preparations of barium
have caused death, viz., the chloride and the carbonate.
These may also give rise to specific
nervous symptoms, as cramps and convulsions.</p>

<p><i>Chloride of Barium</i> is found crystallized in irregular
plates or tables, which are permanent in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
air, soluble in water, and of a disagreeable bitter
taste. Half an ounce has proved fatal in two
hours, after causing symptoms of irritation, with
vertigo, paralysis and convulsions.</p>

<p><i>Carbonate of Baryta</i> or <i>Barium Carbonate</i>, in its
native state, occurs in massive radiated crystals,
very heavy, and nearly colorless. Artificially
prepared, as sold in the shops, it is a fine, tasteless,
odorless powder, almost insoluble in hot or
cold water. One drachm is said to have destroyed
life, but recovery has taken place after a much
larger dose.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The sulphate of soda or sulphate of
magnesia, or some earthy sulphate, should be
speedily administered, by which the poison will
be converted into an inert insoluble sulphate of
baryta. Emetics should also be given, or the
stomach-pump used.</p>

<h3>SALTS OF THE METALS:
ZINC&mdash;SILVER&mdash;TIN&mdash;BISMUTH&mdash;CHROME&mdash;IRON.</h3>

<p class="p2">Two preparations of <span class="smcap">ZINC</span> must be noticed:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphate of Zinc</span> (<i>White Vitriol</i>, <i>White Copperas</i>.)&mdash;This
is a very mild irritant, resembling
in its appearance Epsom salts and oxalic acid. It
is very useful as an emetic in scruple or half-drachm
doses, dissolved in any thin fluid.</p>

<p>In one case an ounce was accidentally taken.
Great pain in the stomach, vomiting, and prostration,
soon set in. Subsequently there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
gastritis, and recovery only occurred after a prolonged
convalescence.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Vomiting is to be encouraged by
milk or albuminous fluids; after which remedies
containing tannin (strong tea, decoction of oak
bark, or tincture of Peruvian bark) are to be
given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloride of Zinc.</span>&mdash;A solution of chloride of
zinc forms a valuable disinfectant, but is also a
dangerous irritant, or, if sufficiently strong, a corrosive
poison. Sir William Burnett’s Fluid consists
of gr. xxv of this salt to the drachm of water.
It has been taken in mistake for fluid magnesia,
pale ale, &amp;c., and has caused death.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;A burning sensation in the mouth
and throat is immediately produced. This is followed
by nausea, vomiting, and signs of collapse.
Death has occurred in less than four hours.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The mucous membrane
of the throat and stomach has been found
corrugated, hard, and leathery. In the case of a
sailor who died from about half a pint of Burnett’s
solution, the body was livid, the neck swollen,
the cerebral vessels were engorged, and the lungs
were congested. The mucous coat of the stomach
was of a purple red, and partially corroded, while
the pyloric orifice looked as if caustic had been
applied to it. There were patches of congestion
in different parts of the small intestines.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Albuminous drinks, followed by
some preparation of tannin, will be needed.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;Zinc is distinguished from all other substances
by giving a white precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen.
The solution containing it
must not be too acid or no precipitate will be
formed. Zinc also gives white precipitates with
ferrocyanide of potassium and ammonia.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nitrate of Silver</span> (<i>Lunar Caustic</i>).&mdash;This is a
powerful irritant, and has proved fatal in at least
two instances. The antidote is common salt,
which must be given immediately, followed by
emetics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tin.</span>&mdash;The chlorides of tin being employed in
dyeing, color-making, &amp;c., may lead to their being
used as poisons, or being taken accidentally.
Death from their use is rare. They are decomposed
by magnesia, which should therefore be
freely administered, followed by albuminous and
mucilaginous drinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bismuth.</span>&mdash;The nitrate or magistery of bismuth
has caused death in nine days, after a dose of two
drachms. The symptoms were those of a strong
irritant, but in all probability were caused by
some impurity in the substance. Arsenic is frequently
present in this way. As no antidote is
known, vomiting must be promoted and emollient
drinks freely given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrome.</span>&mdash;The bichromate of potassium is found
in the form of orange-red crystals, which yield a
yellow acid solution. It is used as a dye, and has
caused death in more than one instance. Emetics
and magnesia or chalk, must be the remedies employed.</p>

<p>It is well to know that this substance is apt to
produce troublesome sores on the hands of those
engaged in its manufacture. Some slight abrasion
begins the lesion, which does not heal, but forms
on its surface a tough slough, which separating,
leaves a foul ulcer with hard edges, and most
untractable, behind it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphate of Iron</span> (<i>Green Vitriol</i>, <i>Copperas</i>).&mdash;Although
not a powerful irritant, sulphate of iron
has proved fatal when taken in a large dose. It
is sometimes given to procure abortion. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<i>perchloride of iron</i> has also produced alarming
symptoms, after being taken for the same purpose.
Dr. Christison relates the case of a man who died
in five weeks from an ounce and a half of the
tincture. Magnesia and diluents, freely administered,
must constitute the treatment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>SIMPLE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL IRRITANTS.</h3>

<p class="p2">This division of the class of simple irritants is
an important one, on account of the substances
composing it consisting in considerable part of
ordinary remedies or drugs, which given in over
doses, may produce symptoms of poisoning. They
chiefly give rise to vomiting and purging.</p>

<h4>VEGETABLE IRRITANTS.</h4>

<p>The most important are <i>aloes</i>, <i>colocynth</i>, <i>jalap</i>,
<i>gamboge</i>, <i>scammony</i>, <i>elaterium</i>, <i>croton oil</i>, <i>castor oil
seeds</i>, various species of <i>arum</i>, <i>euphorbium</i>, <i>bryony</i>,
<i>mesereon</i>, <i>physic nut</i>, and others less commonly
known. Dr. Taylor says that aloes and colocynth
are the basis of <i>Morrison’s pills</i>, which in many instances
have induced fatal purging. In <i>Holloway’s
pills</i>, aloes is the chief ingredient. A favorite
remedy with nurses for promoting the catamenia is
<i>hierapicra</i>, a brown powder consisting of four parts
of aloes to one of canella bark. This may give
rise to dangerous symptoms.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> induced by these substances are
those of irritation of the intestinal canal, severe
pain, vomiting, diarrhœa, tenesmus, &amp;c.; followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
by collapse, cold sweats, and occasionally convulsions.
These effects may also be produced by
diseased and decayed vegetables.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> must be directed to the removal
of the injurious substance by emetics, &amp;c., unless
spontaneous vomiting has freely taken place, when
it need merely be encouraged by the use of diluents.
If the irritant has passed out of the stomach
into the intestines it must be carried off by purgatives,
especially castor oil. The inflammatory
symptoms should be cautiously combated, on account
of the great prostration usually caused by
these poisons. Opiates, emollient enemata, and
fomentations to the abdomen will subsequently be
found useful.</p>

<h4>SIMPLE ANIMAL IRRITANTS.</h4>

<p>The substances which require consideration
under this head, though few, are important.</p>

<p><i>Poisonous Fish.</i>&mdash;Several kinds of fish are constantly
poisonous, while some only act injuriously
on particular constitutions. The chief effects are
sickness and vomiting, irritation of the eyes, depression,
and severe urticaria or nettle-rash. In
this country the different varieties of shell-fish are
those most frequently injurious, especially cockles,
mussels, crabs and such-like.</p>

<p><i>Poisonous Meat.</i>&mdash;The flesh of animals which
have died of disease has produced serious symptoms
when eaten, and has even destroyed life.
Several substances, as sausages, cheese, bacon, &amp;c.,
also become poisonous from putrefaction.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> in these instances should consist
in the use of emetics, purgatives, and diluents.
The vital power must be supported by stimulants,
tonics, nutritious diet, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>IRRITANT GASES.</h3>

<p class="p2">The chief are chlorine, sulphurous-acid gas, nitrous-acid
gas, and hydrochloric-acid gas. When
diluted, they admit of being inhaled; not so when
pure.</p>

<p><i>Chlorine.</i>&mdash;This gas has a greenish-yellow color,
and a powerful suffocating odor. It is used to
fumigate buildings, being a valuable disinfectant.
Chlorine is employed by the calico-printer and
paper-maker for its bleaching properties. The
men who work in an atmosphere slightly impregnated
with it suffer from dyspepsia, but are long-lived,
and it has been supposed to be actually
beneficial to consumptives. Any attempt to inspire
chlorine in its concentrated state would at
once prove fatal by closing the glottis and causing
asphyxia. When diluted it excites excessive
irritation of the air-passages, cough, difficulty of
breathing, and inflammation.</p>

<p>In poisoning by chlorine, the inhalation of a
small quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen appeared
to afford relief in a case reported by Christison,
but with that, or any other of the irritant gases,
our treatment must chiefly consist in the instant
removal of the sufferer to pure air. Then the
cautious inhalation of ammonia, sulphuric ether,
or the vapor of warm water, will be useful.</p>

<p><i>Sulphurous Acid Gas</i> is one of the products
formed by the combustion of ordinary coal. It
possesses bleaching and antiseptic properties; and
is very irritating when inspired.</p>

<p><i>Nitrous Acid Gas</i> is a very violent poison when
inhaled, producing inflammation of the lungs, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&amp;c.
It has proved fatal in several instances, when
given off by nitric acid.</p>

<p><i>Hydrochloric Acid Gas</i> is irrespirable in its concentrated
state, and when diluted produces great
irritation of the lungs and air-passages. This gas,
which is a waste product in the manufacture of
washing soda, is the chief cause of the barrenness
which surrounds soda works where it is allowed
to escape, it being extremely destructive to vegetable
life.</p>

<p><i>Ammonia.</i>&mdash;It has been already noticed (p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>)
that the vapor of ammonia is poisonous, exciting
inflammation of the larynx, bronchitis, and pneumonia.
Serious symptoms have sometimes arisen
from its indiscriminate application in cases of
syncope, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="III_SPECIFIC_IRRITANT_POISONS" id="III_SPECIFIC_IRRITANT_POISONS">III.&mdash;SPECIFIC IRRITANT POISONS.</a></h2>

<p>By Specific Irritant Poisons we mean those
which, taken internally, produce local inflammation
or irritation, these being of course indicated
by certain constitutional symptoms; but over and
above these, which may be the result of ordinary
inflammation, there are certain specific signs of the
action of a poison, in most instances peculiar, and
frequently pointing directly to the poison employed.
This group is one of the utmost importance
in Toxicology, and includes substances acting in
many different ways, all, however, giving rise to
the common symptoms of gastric irritation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>SPECIFIC MINERAL IRRITANTS.</h3>

<h4>IODINE AND IODIDE OF POTASSIUM.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Iodine</span> is obtained from kelp (the ash of marine
plants) and is a bluish black scaly substance. It
strikes an intense blue color with starch, and
when heated gives off an irritating purple vapor.
It likewise imparts a yellowish-brown stain to the
skin (which may be removed by liquor potassæ)
and mucous membranes, and slowly corrodes these
tissues.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Iodine is an active poison, although its effects
are variable. Some constitutions are violently
affected by two or three grains, whereas others
are uninjured by ten or twenty. Iodine is commonly
employed in medicine in combination with
potassium (iodide of potassium). Of this substance
very large doses may be given (thirty grains
or more, three times a day) in tertiary syphilis,
with none but good effect.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> of poisoning by iodine consist of
an acrid taste, tightness about the throat, epigastric
pain, vomiting, and purging, especially if much
has been taken. In a case which came under observation,
a man took an ounce of the compound
tincture of iodine, in mistake for a purgative
draught. He was immediately seized with an intense
burning pain in the throat and epigastrium,
and vomiting, followed by great thirst, headache,
and syncope. The vomiting was encouraged,
large quantities of arrowroot given, starch enemata
administered, and in twelve hours all the
symptoms had disappeared, leaving him in a state
of exhaustion, from which he recovered in a few
days.</p>

<p>In chronic poisoning (iodism) there are signs of
irritation of the alimentary canal, often a measly
eruption, ptyalism, running from the nose and eyes,
mental and bodily depression, and loss of flesh.
Nothing leads to the belief that it causes absorption
of the testicles or mammæ, as is often asserted.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem appearances</i> would be those due
to an irritant poison, namely, inflammation and
softening of the stomach; the mucous membrane
being detached in different parts, and stained of a
yellow color.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> should consist in the encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>ment
of vomiting, and the free administration of
amylaceous fluids, as gruel, arrowroot, boiled
starch, &amp;c. This should be continued until the
matters vomited are of their natural color; for as
long as any iodine remains they will be rendered
blue, iodide of starch being formed.</p>

<p>The crystals <i>of iodide of potassium</i> are white
cubes, very soluble in water, and permanent in
the air; though when impure they have a yellowish
tinge, and are deliquescent. In a few instances
this valuable medicine appears to have given rise
to troublesome symptoms, even when administered
in small doses. Mr. Erichsen has reported a remarkable
case, in which five grains produced
coryza, conjunctivitis, difficulty of breathing, and
other serious effects, promptly ceasing with the
discontinuance of the medicine. The <i>treatment</i>
must consist in emptying the stomach by emetics
or the stomach-pump, and administering starchy
diluents.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i> 1. Iodine may be readily detected by the
blue color it gives to starch.</p>

<p>Iodide of potassium gives the same when the
iodine is set free by an acid, such as sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p>2. It also forms a scarlet precipitate with perchloride
of mercury; and</p>

<p>3. It gives a yellow precipitate with acetate of
lead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3>PHOSPHORUS.</h3>

<p class="p2">This substance is sold in a pure state in small
wax-like cylinders, which must be preserved under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
water. It is soluble in oil, alcohol, ether, and
chloroform, and still more so in carbon disulphide;
it is luminous in the dark, and it ignites at a very
low temperature, giving off a dense white smoke.
Phosphorus is much more frequently used as a
poison abroad than in England; but since restrictions
have been put on the sale of poisons, and
rat poisons containing it have been more common,
cases of poisoning have more frequently occurred,
and are likely to do so even oftener in future.
The cases which have occurred show that it is a
very powerful irritant, and capable of causing
death when taken, even in small doses. One
grain has caused death; the shortest period in
which it has followed the administration of the
poison being four hours.</p>

<p>The phosphorous paste sold consists of flour,
sugar, and fat, with phosphorous, ordinarily colored
with Prussian blue. Coloring matter is also
generally present in lucifer-match tops, which
contain phosphorus and chlorate of potash, or
nitre; hence, the vomited matters after either of
these has been swallowed may be variously colored.
In the so-called &#8220;safety matches&#8221; the phosphorus
is on the box and not on the match. Phosphorus
does not readily lend itself to the purposes
of the criminal, its luminosity, its taste, and its
garlic odor rendering it difficult of concealment.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> of poisoning by phosphorus are
very varied, often insidious. At first there may be
merely the ordinary signs of irritant poisoning.
The vomited matters are luminous in the dark,
sometimes bilious, sometimes bloody. There is
very great prostration, and there may be diarrhœa
with bloody stools. These symptoms sometimes
abate, and everything seems going on well, when
suddenly a new train of symptoms, still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
serious, develop themselves. These are such as
would occur in the worst forms of blood poisoning:
harsh, dry, yellow skin, with discharges of
blood from the various passages, and the formation
of extravasations below the skin. The urine
is ordinarily retained or suppressed, what little
there is being albuminous or bile-stained. Finally,
acute delirium with convulsions sets in; the patient
dies comatose a few hours after taking the
poison, or it may be as many months.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem appearances</i> after death by phosphorus
are very peculiar. If the case has proved
rapidly fatal there will be the ordinary signs of
irritant poisoning, with, in addition, softening of
the stomach, bloody or gangrenous patches, blood
in the intestines and bladder, and bloody serum
in the peritoneal cavity. In many respects the
lesions resemble those of the worst forms of sea
scurvy; but the most marked changes are the remarkable
fatty degeneration of the liver, kidneys,
heart and other muscles, especially of the first,
which is often greatly atrophied.</p>

<p>The diagnosis will depend on the peculiar odor
of garlic exhaled by the patient and the luminosity
of the vomited matters, in addition to the other
signs referred to.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;There is no regular antidote for
phosphorus; early evacuation by the stomach-pump
and the free promotion of vomiting are the
main points. Magnesia or its carbonate should be
given freely in mucilaginous fluids. Oils had
better be avoided, except for the purpose of removing
all traces of the poison by the stomach-pump.
Prompt treatment is all in all.</p>

<p><i>Detection.</i>&mdash;There is but one really satisfactory
plan for detecting phosphorus in organic mixtures,
that invented by Mitscherlich. The suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
material is introduced into a retort, and acidulated
with sulphuric acid. The stem of the retort is
conducted into a glass vessel kept cool by a
stream of water on the outside. The retort is
heated, and distillation allowed to go on in the
dark. If phosphorus be present it passes over as
vapor, and is condensed in the cool vessel beyond.
At each condensation a flash of light is perceived,
which is the test relied on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chronic Poisoning</span> by phosphorus used to be
exceedingly common among match manufacturers,
but is now, comparatively speaking, rare, allotropic
or amorphous phosphorus being much more
generally employed than it used to be, and the
ventilation of the workshops being better. Its
subjects used to be attacked with caries of the
gums, gradually extending and implicating the
jaw, and giving rise to great deformity.</p>

<h3>ARSENIC.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Arsenic</span> is by far the most important of metallic
poisons, whether we consider the deadliness of its
effects or the fatal frequency with which they are
made manifest. Arsenic exists as an impurity in
several metallic ores, notably in iron pyrites,
which being commonly employed as a material
for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, renders
arsenic one of the most frequent impurities of
commercial oil of vitriol. This should never be
forgotten in testing any substance for the poison.
To the common medicinal preparation of arsenic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
consisting of <i>arsenious acid</i>, or <i>arsenites</i>, and the so-called
<i>chloride of arsenic</i>, must be added the <i>arseniates
of potash and soda</i>; the sulphides of arsenic&mdash;as,
the <i>red sulphide</i>, or <i>realgar</i>, and the <i>yellow sulphide</i>,
or <i>orpiment</i>; the <i>arsenite of copper</i>, or <i>Scheele’s
green</i>, and others. They all produce similar symptoms,
and poisoning by either of them requires
nearly the same treatment.</p>

<p>According to Von Tschudi, some of the peasants
in parts of Styria and Hungary eat arsenic, taking
from two to five grains daily; the men doing so in
order that they may gain strength, and be able to
endure fatigue, the women that they may improve
their complexions. These statements are so contrary
to all that we know of the power of this
poison, that they have been regarded as unworthy
of credit. Evidence has, however, been brought
forward by Dr. Craig Maclagan, of Edinburgh,
which shows clearly that arsenic-eating is something
more than a mere fiction. This gentleman
gave, and saw a Styrian eat, a piece of arsenious
acid, weighing over four grains, and afterwards
determined the presence of arsenic in urine passed
in his presence by the said peasant. Advantage
was taken of these reports in the trial of Miss
Madeline Smith (Edinburgh, July, 1857), when the
court was asked to believe that arsenic found in
the possession of the prisoner was used by her as
a cosmetic.</p>

<p><i>Arsenite of Copper</i>, in one form or another, either
as Scheele’s green, emerald green, Brunswick
green, &amp;c., is unfortunately largely employed in
the manufacture of green paper-hangings, artificial
flowers, toys, and even some kinds of confectionery.
Too many cases of ill-health caused by this
practice have been recorded to permit any doubt
as to its deleterious effects. These may be mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>fested
by people living in rooms furnished with
such paper-hangings. The chief symptoms are,
sneezing, lachrymation, frontal headache, nausea,
and loss of appetite, with colicky pains, thirst, &amp;c.
Among those employed in preparing the paper-hangings
more serious symptoms manifest themselves.
The irritation of the pigment gives rise to
circular patches of ulceration on the alæ of the
nose, in the folds of the arm, in the groin and
scrotum&mdash;in short, wherever dirt tends to lodge.
These prove very untractable, except the employment
be abandoned. In November, 1861, a young
woman died in London from the poisonous effects
of arsenite of copper used in dusting wax leaves.
The workmen who employ the pigment in its dry
state suffer, while those who use it in a moist condition
are probably unaffected by it. A simple
method for roughly detecting arsenite of copper in
these fabrics was published in the <i>Chemical News</i>
(vol. 1, p. 12). A small portion of the suspected
material is to be put into a test tube with strong
ammonia. If a blue tint be produced, a salt of
copper is shown to be present. Withdraw the object,
and drop a piece of nitrate of silver into the
ammonia; if arsenic be there, the nitrate of silver
will be covered with a yellow coating of arseniate
of silver, which will disappear on stirring. On
igniting arsenical paper and allowing it to smoulder,
the odor of garlic may be detected in the
fumes given off. Another mode in which the
noxious effects of arsenic are produced is by the
use of bright green tarlatans as ball dresses.
One could hardly conceive a more deadly amusement
than dancing in an arsenicated dress, sweeping
against an arsenicated wall-paper. When
both are lightly adherent the arsenic is scattered
in showers about the room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsenious Acid</span> (<i>White Oxide of Arsenic</i>, <i>White
Arsenic</i>, <i>Arsenic</i>).&mdash;This is the preparation of arsenic
most frequently used as a poison; the facility
with which it used to be procured, its cheapness
(twopence an ounce), and the ease with which it
may be administered, all tended to recommend it
to the murderer or suicide. According to a parliamentary
report, the number of fatal cases of
poisoning in England in the years 1837, 1838,
amounted to 543, of which no less than 186 were
caused by arsenic, 185 arising from the use of the
arsenious acid, and 1 from orpiment or yellow arsenic.</p>

<p>Since the Act of 1851 (14 Vict. cap. xiii.) the
deaths from this agent have greatly decreased.
This statute chiefly enacts that arsenic is not to be
sold without the seller entering the transaction in
a proper book, without a witness, nor without its
being mixed with soot or indigo, unless such admixture
would render it unfit for the purchaser’s
business.</p>

<p>Arsenious acid is found in commerce in the form
of a white powder or in small opaque cakes. It is
very feebly acid, tasteless, or slightly sweet in small
doses, though not very soluble, an ounce of cold
water dissolving about one grain. The quantity so
held in solution may, however, be increased by
dissolving the arsenic in boiling water and allowing
it to cool. The shortest period within which
it was believed arsenic would cause death was two
hours; but Dr. Taylor gives a case where death
with tetanic symptoms followed the fatal dose in
twenty minutes. The smallest quantity known to
have proved fatal is two grains. Two grains and
a half killed a girl nineteen years of age in thirty-six
hours. Half a grain will produce alarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
symptoms; and yet recovery has ensued after doses
of half an ounce or an ounce.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;These commence within half an
hour or an hour of swallowing the poison. There
is faintness, nausea, incessant vomiting, and a
burning pain in the epigastrium, increased on
pressure, and gradually extending over the whole
abdomen, followed by headache, diarrhœa, a sense
of constriction and heat in the fauces and throat,
great thirst, and catching, painful respiration. The
heart’s action becomes depressed, the pulse is quick
and feeble; there is great restlessness and anxiety;
cold, clammy skin, and perhaps coma are present;
and death usually occurs within twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>These symptoms are liable to great variety, the
pain and vomiting being occasionally absent, and
the patient being affected as if by a narcotic poison.
In some instances there is troublesome tenesmus,
with heat and excoriation about the anus. Convulsive
movements in the extremities often occur,
with cramp in the legs, especially if the diarrhœa
is severe. Death sometimes takes place calmly
from collapse, sometimes it follows on convulsions.</p>

<p>The vomited matters may be red or brown from
admixture with blood or bile; or they may be blue
or black, if the arsenic has been colored with
indigo or soot. Although the vomiting, pain, &amp;c.,
are generally continuous, yet sometimes all the
symptoms remit, and the patient rallies for a time,
only to sink more rapidly.</p>

<p>The symptoms of <i>chronic</i> poisoning by arsenic
are loss of appetite, a silvery coating to the tongue,
thirst, nausea, colicky pains, diarrhœa, frontal
headache, langor, sleeplessness, cutaneous eruptions,
soreness of the edges of the eyelids, emacia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>tion,
anæmia, convulsions, and death. In some
cases, when small doses have been administered
for many days in succession, with the intent to
destroy life, the symptoms have been masked by
other substances. The most marked results of
this practice have been sickness and vomiting, pain
in the bowels, nervous irritability, and emaciation.
The practitioner must be careful not to mistake
these symptoms for those due to simple gastritis
or enteritis.</p>

<p>Arsenic is not a poison that accumulates in the
system, but is slowly eliminated from it especially
by the kidneys, but partly also by the bile.</p>

<p>The local application of arsenic to the mucous
membranes, to wounds, or to surfaces deprived of
their cuticle, produces constitutional effects similar
to those just described. The only difference is
that the symptoms show themselves more slowly.
Not a few lives have been sacrificed from the
application by ignorant quacks of a mixture of
arsenious acid, realgar, and oxide of iron to
ulcerating cancers.</p>

<p>Cases of compound poisoning have been met
with. When arsenic is taken mixed with opium,
the symptoms produced by the former are masked.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;Arsenic appears to
exercise a specific influence over the alimentary
canal, and more especially over the stomach; for
in whatever manner it may have been introduced
into the system, it is to this organ that we must
look for its effects. These effects consist in the
signs of acute inflammation commencing in this
viscus, and often extending along the duodenum,
small intestines, and colon. In acute cases the
stomach is the viscus most affected; but in chronic
cases the whole alimentary canal is found inflamed
and ulcerated, particularly the duodenum and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
rectum. When death has occurred within five
hours of taking the poison, the stomach has been
found intensely inflamed in an adult; while the
same result was witnessed in a child who died at
the end of two hours. The stomach often contains
a dark grumous fluid, occasionally tinged with
blood. On removing the contents the mucous
membrane is seen red and inflamed, the inflammation
being most intense around certain spots.
On examining these spots, particles of arsenic will
probably be found adhering to the walls of the
stomach and surrounded by a zone of inflammatory
redness. Sometimes also blood is effused
into the visceral walls, giving rise to an appearance
resembling gangrene. Ulceration of any of
the coats of the stomach is rare, and perforation is
still more so.</p>

<p>In a few exceptional cases there has been no
appearance of inflammation in the stomach or
bowels.</p>

<p>Putrefaction of the body is said to be remarkably
retarded after death from arsenic.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The first object must be to expel
the poison from the stomach, for which purpose
the stomach-pump may be advantageously employed,
or emetics of sulphate of zinc, mustard, or
ipecacuan administered, unless vomiting is already
present. The sickness must be promoted by the
free use of albuminous or mucilaginous diluents.
Raw eggs beaten up in milk are particularly useful,
as is likewise a mixture of albumen, milk,
and limewater. Taylor advises equal parts of oil
and limewater, for the oil invests the poison, and
the lime renders it less soluble. A large dose of
castor oil (℥j to ℥ij) may be given, to carry off any
of the poison which may have passed into the intestines,
as soon as sickness has subsided. Animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
charcoal, calcined magnesia, &amp;c., when taken in
large quantities, may be of service by enveloping
the arsenic, and preventing its contact with the
mucous membrane of the stomach; but oil or
milk will act more efficiently in this manner. The
hydrated peroxide of iron<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> should be administered
moist, and in large doses, after the stomach-pump
has been used; or indeed, mixed with water, it
may be first introduced and then expelled, thus
washing out the stomach by means of the stomach-pump.
This is the most efficient antidote known.</p>

<p>The subsequent treatment must be conducted on
general principles, according to the severity of the
symptoms; but the great depression of the nervous
and vascular systems must not be overlooked
in combating any inflammatory action. Henbane
or opium, in many instances combined with stimulants,
ice internally, and hot fomentations externally,
will frequently be found of great service.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;In its <i>solid state</i> arsenious acid may be
known by the following properties. Heated on
platinum foil or on the point of a penknife, it produces
a white smoke and is entirely volatilized.
If some of the powder be heated in a small test tube,
it will be sublimed, and small octahedral crystals,
visible to the naked eye or by a lens, obtained.
If arsenious acid be mixed with freshly-burnt powdered
charcoal, and heated in a small test tube, a
ring of shining metallic arsenic of a grey color
will be found on the cool portion of the tube, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
an odor of garlic is perceptible. If this deposit
be driven about from place to place it will gradually
become oxidized, and octahedral crystals
of arsenious acid formed. Further, if the tube be
divided and the part containing the arsenious acid
be washed out with distilled water, the liquid tests
may be applied to the solution. This is called
the Reduction test. It is very delicate, detecting
according to Christison, the 300th part of a grain.</p>

<p><i>In solution</i>, this substance may be detected by
what are called the liquid tests. A solution of
arsenic in water is colorless, almost tasteless, and
has a very slightly acid reaction. If a few drops
be evaporated on a glass slide and examined by
the microscope, numerous minute and mostly imperfect
octahedral crystals, or an amorphous
deposit, will be seen, presenting triangular surfaces
by reflected light.</p>

<p>1. The <i>ammonio-nitrate of silver</i> (prepared by
adding a few drops of liquor ammoniæ to a solution
of nitrate of silver, till the brown oxide of silver at
first precipitated is nearly redissolved) throws
down with arsenious acid a rich yellow deposit of
arsenite of silver.</p>

<p>2. The <i>ammonio-sulphate of copper</i> (formed by
adding liquor ammoniæ to a solution of sulphate
of copper till the bluish-white oxide of copper is
almost redissolved) produces a pale green precipitate,
arsenite of copper, or Scheele’s green.
Care must be taken not to add too much of the test
in the first instance, otherwise its blue may overpower
the green of the precipitate.</p>

<p>3. <i>Sulphuretted hydrogen water</i> precipitates a
yellow deposit of sulphide of arsenic. It is better,
however, to use pure and well-washed sulphuretted
hydrogen generated in the usual manner.
Care must be taken that the liquid is not alkaline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
or no precipitate will be produced, even though
arsenic be present. For this reason yellow sulphide
of ammonium will not precipitate arsenic until
acidulated with pure hydrochloric or some such
acid. The precipitate should be collected, carefully
washed, and dried. It should then be mixed
with black flux or dry ferrocyanide of potassium
and reduced, as already described.</p>

<p>These tests are so delicate, especially the first,
that they will detect the 8000th part of a grain of
arsenic in solution; they should be employed
successively. There are several other processes
which require to be noticed, namely, Marsh’s process,
the process known as Reinsch’s process,
Fresenius’s process, and the Destillation process.</p>

<p><i>Marsh’s Test or Process.</i>&mdash;This process is founded
on the decomposition of arsenious acid by nascent
hydrogen, and the formation of arsenuretted hydrogen
gas, which possesses the following properties:
It burns with a bluish-white flame, and white
smoke (arsenious acid), possessing a slight garlic
odor. If a piece of glass or porcelain be held in
the flame a blackish metallic stain will be deposited
upon it, consisting of metallic arsenic. This
stain might be confounded with one produced by
antimony under similar circumstances. But the
antimonuretted hydrogen gas does not burn with
the odor of the arsenuretted hydrogen; while
the antimonial stain is sooty, and has not a metallic
lustre. The arsenical stain is further readily
dissolved by a solution of chloride of lime (bleaching
powder), whilst the antimonial stain is not
affected. To the stain may be added a few drops
of strong nitric acid; it will dissolve the arsenic;
if this be allowed to evaporate, and the acid be
neutralized, a few drops of nitrate of silver solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
will give a brick-red precipitate of arseniate of
silver.</p>

<p>Marsh’s test is thus accomplished: a flask furnished
with a cork through which pass a funnel
and a long bent tube drawn to a point, is prepared
so that the funnel reaches almost to its bottom.
Several pieces of pure zinc are introduced, and
then some sulphuric acid is poured through the
funnel. In this way hydrogen gas is produced
and escapes by the bent tube. When all the air
has been expelled the gas should be ignited as it
escapes, and a piece of cool porcelain held over
the flame. If there be no deposit it is plain that
neither the zinc nor the sulphuric acid, contains
arsenic. A portion of the suspected fluid is next
introduced into the flask by the funnel, and the
issuing gas again tested. Should a stain giving
the characters alluded to above be produced, the
fluid contains arsenic in some form or other.</p>

<p><i>Reinsch’s Process.</i>&mdash;The suspected liquid is boiled
with from one-sixth to one-eighth of its bulk of
pure hydrochloric acid, and a bright slip of copper
introduced. If arsenic be present the copper
will be coated with it in the form of an iron-grey
deposit. Next after removing the copper, washing
it with distilled water, and drying it between
folds of blotting paper, cut it into slips, and introduce
it into a reduction-tube and apply heat;
arsenious acid will be sublimed and deposited on
the sides of the tube, in the form of minute octahedral
crystals. These may be dissolved in water
and tested in the usual way. Before resorting to
this test, the acid must be examined to make sure
of its purity. This is easily effected by boiling
the copper with a mixture of the hydrochloric acid
and distilled water before adding the suspected
liquid. In conducting the analysis in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Smethurst (Cent. Crim. Court, Aug. 1859) Taylor
and Odling found that all the varieties of copper
in common use for Reinsch’s process contained
arsenic. A copper of ascertained purity must
therefore be used.</p>

<p><i>Arsenic in Organic Matters.</i>&mdash;The following process,
which has been introduced by Dr. Taylor, is
a very convenient one. The suspected matters
are to be thoroughly dried in a water-bath or
otherwise, taking care not to use too great a heat.
They are then to be introduced into a flask fitted
with a long bent tube; to the dried material is to
be added a quantity of strong hydrochloric acid,
proved free from arsenic, sufficient to drench it,
and the whole allowed to digest for some hours.
At the end of that time heat is to be applied to the
flask by means of a sand-bath, and a receiver fitted
to the bent tube. The receiver should contain
a little water, and both it and the bent tube
should be kept cool. As distillation goes on the
arsenic passes over in the form of chloride of arsenic,
and is collected in the receiver beyond. A
second portion of hydrochloric acid may be used
to remove any last traces of arsenic in the organic
material. The arsenic may be recovered from the
chloride by boiling with pure polished copper, as
in Reinsch’s process.</p>

<p>The process of Fresenius and Von Babo given at
page <a href="#Page_31">31</a> is especially adapted for the recovery of
arsenic from organic admixture.</p>

<p>Several cases of poisoning by arsenuretted hydrogen
are on record, some proving fatal.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<h3>ANTIMONIAL COMPOUNDS.</h3>

<p class="p2">In its metallic state antimony is not regarded as
poisonous. Two of its preparations, however,
claim attention; namely, tartar emetic, and chloride
of antimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tartar Emetic</span> (<i>Tartrated</i> or <i>Tartarised Antimony</i>,
<i>Potassio-Tartrate of Antimony</i>, <i>Tartar Emetic</i>).&mdash;Since
the trials of Palmer, Dove, Smethurst,
and Pritchard, poisoning by this compound has attracted
much attention. In large doses it has been
administered without any serious result, a circumstance
which may be accounted for by the
promptitude with which it excites vomiting and
purging. Given in small doses, frequently repeated,
the effects of tartar emetic may be made to
simulate, in some degree, those due to natural
disease.</p>

<p>Three quarters of a grain killed a child; and a
dose of two grains has destroyed an adult, under
circumstances which favored its action. Dr. Taylor
says that from ten to twenty grains taken at
once might prove fatal to an adult; while in
divided doses a smaller quantity might suffice. It
is plain, therefore, that the quantity necessary to
cause death must vary with the condition of the
patient.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;In acute poisoning by this agent
there is a metallic taste, nausea, and violent vomiting,
burning heat with pain in the stomach, and
purging. Difficulty in swallowing, thirst, cramps,
cold perspiration, and great debility soon set in.
Should the case terminate fatally, death may be
preceded by giddiness, insensibility, difficult res<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>piration,
utter prostration, with violent spasms,
tonic or clonic; but even when matters appear to
be most critical, symptoms of improvement are
often manifested, and recovery gradually follows.</p>

<p>The effects of <i>chronic</i> poisoning are, constant
nausea, frequent attacks of vomiting and purging,
a loathing for food, a weak frequent pulse, loss of
muscular power, cold clammy sweats and fatal exhaustion.
The symptoms are of course aggravated
after each administration of the poison, whether
given in food or medicine.</p>

<p>Tartar emetic ointment applied to the skin produces
a pustular eruption like that of smallpox;
while, if much be absorbed, there will be nausea,
sickness, &amp;c. Sometimes this same eruption appears
in the throat and on the skin after swallowing
a large dose.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The most common are
inflammation of the throat, stomach, and intestines.
Sometimes the mucous membrane of the stomach
is softened and infiltrated with blood. The cæcum
and large intestine are also inflamed, especially if
life has been prolonged after the dose, as in chronic
poisoning. The brain and lungs have been found
congested.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Vomiting should be encouraged by
warm greasy water, milk, &amp;c. Liquids containing
tannin, as tea without milk or sugar, decoction of
oak bark, &amp;c., must be freely given. Cinchona
bark in tincture or powder may be advantageously
prescribed. Afterwards opiates may be administered.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;Tartar emetic is soluble in water but not
in alcohol.</p>

<p>In solution tartar emetic may be thus detected:</p>

<p>1. A drop evaporated on a glass slide leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
microscopic crystals, either tetrahedra or cubes,
with the edges bevelled off.</p>

<p>2. The solution may further be proved to contain
antimony by passing through it sulphuretted
hydrogen or adding to it sulphide of ammonium,
either of which throws down an orange-red precipitate
of sulphide of antimony. This precipitate
is soluble in strong hydrochloric acid, which being
diluted, throws down a white precipitate.</p>

<p>3. The three dilute mineral acids (nitric is best)
throw down a white precipitate with tartar emetic,
which is soluble in excess of the acid used or in
tartaric acid.</p>

<p>The metal may be separated from organic substances
by Marsh’s or Reinsch’s process.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloride of Antimony</span> (<i>Terchloride</i> or <i>Butter of
Antimony</i>) is a powerfully corrosive liquid. It
produces violent inflammation and corrosion of the
whole intestinal canal; occasionally also drowsiness,
as from the use of a narcotic.</p>

<p>Dr. Taylor has collected the histories of four
cases of poisoning by butter of antimony, three of
which recovered. The fourth, in which a gentleman
took from two to three ounces, proved fatal in ten
hours and a half, after producing great prostration,
nausea, violent griping pain, and tenesmus,
followed by a tendency to sleep. On inspection,
the whole of the inside of the alimentary canal
was blackened, as if it had been charred; there
was but little mucous membrane remaining, and
the parts were much softened.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Magnesia must be administered in
milk, together with the remedies recommended in
poisoning by tartar emetic.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<h3>MERCURY AND ITS COMPOUNDS.</h3>

<p class="p2">Of the preparations of mercury, corrosive sublimate
is the most important to the toxicologist;
for although they all possess in a greater or less
degree poisonous properties, yet the instances in
which the other compounds have been used to
destroy life are extremely rare. The treatment in
all cases must be the same. It is worthy of remark
that mercury, whilst in the metallic state, is
destitute of injurious properties, but if oxidized or
otherwise rendered fit for absorption, it may give
rise to dangerous symptoms. Thus, workers in
mercurial mines suffer much, as did those who
were employed in silvering looking-glasses by the
old process. Large doses (from half a pound to
two pounds) have been given in obstinate cases of
constipation, intussusception, &amp;c., without any
remarkable effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corrosive Sublimate</span> (<i>Oxymuriate of Mercury</i>,
<i>Chloride of Mercury</i>, <i>Bichloride of Mercury</i>).&mdash;This
preparation of Mercury, which, more strictly
speaking, belongs, like the chlorides of zinc and
antimony, to the class Corrosives, is usually met
with in the form of imperfect crystalline masses,
or as a white powder. It has an acrid, coppery
taste, so powerful that but little could be swallowed
without the individual becoming aware of
it. It is very soluble in water. Three grains is
the smallest quantity that has been known to
prove fatal; and from this to five grains may probably
be stated as the average dose necessary to
destroy life. Recovery has taken place after as
much as eighty grains had been swallowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Death has occurred in less than half an hour;
while, in some instances, life has been maintained
until the sixth day, and in one instance (where
between three and four scruples had been swallowed)
until the twelfth day. It is probable that
the average duration of fatal cases is from twenty-four
to thirty-six hours.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;In the majority of cases the symptoms
commence immediately, with an acrid metallic
taste, often described as coppery, and a sense
of constriction and burning heat in the throat and
stomach. The burning pain gradually extends
over the abdomen, and is much increased by pressure.
There is nausea, with vomiting of the contents
of the stomach. These matters are sometimes
mixed with blood and stringy masses of
mucus. The sickness is accompanied by diarrhœa
or dysentery, swelling of the abdomen, and increased
pain. The countenance becomes flushed and
often swollen, though it is occasionally pallid and
anxious; the lips and tongue get white and
shrivelled; there is frequently some dyspnœa,
while the pulse is small, or wiry and frequent;
and death is preceded by faintness, cramps, insensibility,
or convulsions.</p>

<p>Should these effects not prove rapidly fatal, the
pain will gradually become lessened, though
attacks of colic and nausea may come on at intervals
for several days. Often the secretion of urine
is almost, or even quite, suppressed. After a time
there are symptoms of hectic fever, with much depression.
The gums and salivary glands also
become swollen, there is a coppery taste in the
mouth, the breath is very fœtid, and there is severe
ptyalism or salivation. This latter effect is the most
prominent feature in the <i>chronic</i> form of poisoning,
where small and frequently-repeated doses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
have been given: it often proceeds to such an
extent as to cause death, when the patient would
otherwise probably recover.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that salivation sometimes
arises where no mercurial of any kind has
been given. Thus arsenic, bismuth, lead, iodide
of potassium, opium, &amp;c., may induce it in some very
peculiar constitutions. Small medicinal doses (as
a few grains of calomel) may also excite it in certain
susceptible individuals; and especially in
persons suffering from renal disease. It may also
occur spontaneously, as in stomatitis or inflammation
of the mouth; and very troublesome examples
of it may occur in pregnant women.</p>

<p>It is strange that neither in acute nor chronic
mercurial poisoning do we observe any marked
loss of muscular power. Yet workers in quicksilver
(owing to the absorption of the fumes of
mercury during respiration) are very apt to suffer
from a peculiar kind of paralysis; which commences
with inability to direct the hands and
arms, and goes on to a shaking or trembling of
all parts of the body.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The appearances produced
by corrosive sublimate are confined chiefly
to the digestive canal. The mucous membrane of
the mouth, fauces, and œsophagus is softened and
of a whitish or bluish-grey color. The stomach
also presents marks of violent inflammation;
beneath the mucous membrane numerous patches
of extravasated blood are seen, and frequently
corrosion or ulceration has been found. The large
and small intestines, the peritoneum, and especially
the urinary organs, often appear inflamed. In
many instances the bladder has been much contracted.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;This must consist in the removal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the poison and the administration of antidotes.
Vomiting is best promoted by administering
copious draughts of fluids containing albumen:
but if necessary ipecacuan may be given. The
white and the yolk of raw eggs with milk should
be abundantly administered. Gluten has been
much recommended, and may readily be prepared
by washing flour in a muslin bag under a stream
of water; but on an emergency it will be best to
exhibit the flour at once, made into a paste with
milk or water. The free use of demulcent drinks,
milk, and ice will be very grateful to the patient’s
feelings. Gargles of alum or borax do some good.
Opiates may be given in small doses, if there be
much pain, and we should allow only a milk or
farinaceous diet. Sucking chlorate of potash has
been recommended to check the salivation. The
most useful remedy, however, is the iodide of
potassium; for this salt destroys the compounds
formed by the union of mercury with certain of
the tissues, and eliminates the poison through the
kidneys.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;Corrosive sublimate is completely volatilized
by heat.</p>

<p>1. Liquor potassæ added to its solution gives a
yellow precipitate. This precipitate, if washed,
dried, and heated in a test tube, gives a ring of
metallic mercury in the form of globules in the
cool part of the tube. In like fashion corrosive
sublimate itself may be reduced and volatilized if
heated with black flux.</p>

<p>2. On adding a solution of iodide of potassium
to a small quantity of the solution, a bright
scarlet precipitate, soluble in excess of iodide of
potassium, is produced.</p>

<p>3. If a drop or two of a solution of corrosive
sublimate, slightly acidulated with hydrochloric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
acid, be placed on a sovereign, and the solution
and the gold be touched with a piece of zinc or an
iron key, the mercury will be deposited as a bright
silvery stain on the gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calomel</span> (<i>Subchloride</i> or <i>Chloride of Mercury</i>) is a
heavy white powder, which is usually regarded as
a safe medicine. Yet, in some peculiar constitutions,
it has caused excessive salivation and death,
even though only a few grains have been given.
In large doses it may be regarded as an irritant
poison. It is distinguished from corrosive sublimate
by forming a black precipitate with caustic
potash and by its insolubility in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ammonio Chloride of Mercury</span> (<i>White Precipitate</i>).&mdash;This
substance is a chalky looking powder,
containing about eighty per cent. of mercury. It
produces vomiting, purging, great pain in the
stomach, cramps, and convulsions. Out of fourteen
cases, collected by Dr. Taylor, in which from
a few to forty grains were taken, only two proved
fatal.</p>

<p>The remaining preparations of mercury, which
in rare instances have been used as poisons, are
the <i>Red Oxide of Mercury</i> (red precipitate); the
<i>Red Sulphuret of Mercury</i> (cinnabar or vermilion);
the <i>Cyanide of Mercury</i>; the <i>Nitrates of Mercury</i>;
and <i>Turpeth Mineral</i>.</p>

<p>Mercury may be separated from organic admixture
by Reinsch’s method.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS OF LEAD.</h3>

<p class="p2">Lead, in its metallic state, is not injurious. It
is, however, really acted on by acids, exposure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the atmosphere, &amp;c., and converted into carbonate
of lead. The chief compounds of this metal which
have been found to produce poisonous effects are
the acetate, subacetate, and the carbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acetate of Lead</span> (<i>Sugar of Lead</i>).&mdash;This is sold
as a glistening white powder, or in the form of
crystalline masses resembling loaf sugar. It is
more frequently used as a poison than either of
the other compounds. It is very soluble in water
and has a sweetish metallic taste. Three or four
instances are recorded in which recovery has taken
place after an ounce of this substance has been
taken in solution.</p>

<p>Mr. Bancks, of Stourbridge, has reported the
particulars of a series of cases of poisoning by the
acetate of lead (<i>Lancet</i>, 5th May, 1849). It appears
that thirty pounds of this substance were accidentally
mixed at the miller’s with eighty sacks of
flour. This was made into bread, from eating
which 500 persons suffered severely. The chief
symptoms were a sense of constriction in the
throat and at the pit of the stomach, crampy pains
round the navel, stiffness of the abdominal muscles,
paralysis of the lower extremities, constipation,
scanty urine, and the formation of a deep
blue line round the gums. Although in many
cases there was great prostration with other
alarming symptoms, yet under the use of purgatives
all recovered. It was noticed that after a
temporary convalescence many of the symptoms
returned in an aggravated form without any
apparent cause. Sometimes there has been vomiting
and purging, and there is great prostration,
with cramps and convulsions.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;They are not usually
very distinct. The stomach and intestines have
been found inflamed, and the surface of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
softened and, in the case of animals, corroded.
There may be no characteristic signs in chronic
poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subacetate of Lead</span> (<i>Goulard’s Extract</i>).&mdash;This
substance is known to have proved fatal in
three or four instances, after having caused great
agony. It is a more powerful poison than the acetate.
It is found in the shops as a whitish-colored
liquid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbonate of Lead</span> (<i>White Lead</i>, <i>Ceruse</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>).&mdash;This
is sold in heavy white masses, looking like
chalk. It is readily acted on by acids, but is very
insoluble in water.</p>

<p>Dr. Snow has reported an instance in which a
child ate a portion, about the size of a marble,
mixed up with oil; it died on the fourth day.
Carbonate of lead derives its greatest interest
from the chronic form of poisoning which it produces
among white lead manufacturers, painters,
&amp;c., known as &#8220;the painters’ colic,&#8221; which too
often terminates in &#8220;lead palsy.&#8221; In these instances
the lead finds its way into the system by
absorption from the digestive canal, the lungs, or
the skin; producing its characteristic effects when
a sufficient amount has been absorbed. It is this
salt which is formed by the action of air and water
upon lead.</p>

<p>The other preparations of this metal do not require
any separate notice.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The sulphates of soda or magnesia
should be freely given dissolved in water. Milk,
or milk and eggs will be useful. If vomiting is
absent, an emetic of sulphate of zinc should be
administered, or the stomach-pump may be advantageously
employed.</p>

<p>For a chemical antidote in poisoning by car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>bonate
of lead Dr. Taylor recommends a mixture
of vinegar and sulphate of magnesia.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;The presence of a salt of lead in solution
may be thus ascertained:&mdash;1. On passing sulphuretted
hydrogen through it, or on adding a few
drops of sulphide of ammonium, a black precipitate
is given. 2. A white precipitate results from
the use of liquor potassæ or liquor ammoniæ. 3.
Dilute sulphuric acid gives a similar precipitate,
which is insoluble in nitric acid. 4. Iodide of
potassium affords a bright yellow deposit (iodide
of lead).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chronic Lead Poisoning.</span>&mdash;The chronic and insidious
effects produced by lead upon the constitution
are deserving of careful attention. Water
impregnated with this metal in its passage through
lead pipes or cisterns, acquires poisonous properties.
Lead-pigments are sometimes improperly
used to color cheese, lozenges, snuff, &amp;c. The
endemic colic of Devonshire was due to the absorption
of lead contained in cider, which had
been made in leaden vessels; and in the wine district
of Poictou attacks of colic were so common,
from the impregnation of wine with this metal,
that we still speak of &#8220;colica Pictonum.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pernicious influence of lead is manifested
among those engaged in the manufacture or use of
lead compounds, especially painters, lead smelters,
plumbers, color grinders, shot manufacturers,
workers in sugar of lead, potters, compositors,
enamellers of cards, &amp;c. These artisans should be
advised to prevent disease by great cleanliness, by
avoiding intoxicating liquors, and by drinking
freely of sulphuric acid lemonade. The substitution
of moist for dry grinding has proved useful.</p>

<p>The most prominent <i>symptoms</i> of chronic poisoning
by lead are as follows: A blue line around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the gums, and the liability of the latter to bleed
from any slight cause; emaciation, a pallid tint of
the complexion, poorness of blood, and a feeble
quick pulse; obstinate constipation, with attacks
of colic relieved by pressure; diminution of the
renal secretion and rheumatic pains; afterwards
comes weakness of the hands, wrists, and arms,
ending in paralysis of the extensors, or &#8220;dropped
wrists,&#8221; creeping up the arms.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of these cases must consist in the
first instance in the use of purgatives; none being
better than sulphate of magnesia with the dilute
sulphuric acid. But the remedy of all others is
the iodide of potassium, in five or ten grain doses
thrice daily; this agent acting most beneficially
when employed in conjunction with galvanism to
the paralysed limbs.</p>

<h3>SALTS OF COPPER.</h3>

<p class="p2">Poisoning with the salts of copper is of comparatively
rare occurrence; when it happens, it is
generally the result of accident. The metal itself
is not poisonous, but the action of the gastric
juice may produce a very deleterious salt. Copper
coins, when swallowed, sometimes on this account
prove mischievous; though usually any ill effects
which ensue are due to their mechanical action.
Salts of copper have been accidentally introduced
into the system by means of food which has been
cooked in copper saucers. The most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
substances of this class to the toxicologist are the
following:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphate of Copper</span> (<i>Blue Vitriol</i>).&mdash;Blue-stone
is met with in large crystals, which are very soluble
in water and possess an acrid metallic taste.
In doses of half an ounce it acts as a powerful irritant.
It has been administered to procure abortion.
In the case of a child sixteen months old,
who sucked some pieces of blue-stone with which
she was playing, death occurred in four hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subacetate of Copper</span> (<i>Verdigris</i>).&mdash;This preparation
is met with in masses, or in the form of a
greenish powder. It possesses a powerful astringent
metallic taste. It is often produced by allowing
substances to stand in coppers. It has proved
fatal in half ounce doses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsenite of Copper</span> (<i>Mineral Green</i>).&mdash;The effects
of this salt have been already referred to.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;Pain in the epigastrium, gradually
extending over the abdomen, violent vomiting&mdash;the
vomited matters being of a blue or green
color&mdash;and diarrhœa, are the symptoms which
set in the most speedily. Then there is usually
dyspnœa, great depression, coldness of the extremities,
headache with giddiness, and slight
tetanic convulsions. Sometimes there is suppression
of urine. Jaundice very frequently occurs&mdash;a
symptom the more important, as it is rarely met
with in most other forms of poisoning. Occasionally
stupor, coma, and paralysis supervene. Should
death ensue, it may occur within a few hours, or
not for several days.</p>

<p>The salts of copper taken in very small doses,
for several days, give rise to a metallic taste in the
mouth, thirst, debility, cramps and colicky pains,
with symptoms of dysentery. In some instances
there has been found retraction of the gums with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the formation of a purple line, very distinct from
the blue mark due to lead.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;Evidences of inflammation
are usually found in the stomach and intestines,
the mucous membrane being often ulcerated
and of a blue-green color. Particles of the
poison may sometimes be found adhering to the
coats of the bowel. Perforation of the intestines
has occurred.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Vomiting sets in spontaneously, and
is to be encouraged by the use of warm water.
The stomach pump will rarely be needed. The
only effectual antidote is albumen. The whites
and yolks of several eggs should therefore be
given, followed immediately by milk or mucilaginous
drinks.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;Solutions of the sulphate and nitrate of
copper are blue; the chloride is green. The salts
of copper may be thus identified:</p>

<p>1. A polished knife or needle introduced into
the solution is soon covered with a coating of
copper.</p>

<p>2. Ammonia produces with a salt of copper a
bluish precipitate, readily soluble in excess of
ammonia, and forming a splendid blue solution.</p>

<p>3. Ferrocyanide of potassium gives a claret-colored
gelatinous precipitate, if the copper be
abundant; otherwise the deposit is of a light
brown.</p>

<p>4. Sulphuretted hydrogen gas yields a deep-brown
precipitate.</p>

<p>5. A few drops of the copper solution are to be
placed on platinum foil, and slightly acidulated;
on touching the foil, through the solution, with a
strip of zinc, metallic copper is deposited on the
patinum.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />
SPECIFIC VEGETABLE IRRITANTS.</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Laburnum</span> (<i>Cytisus laburnum</i>).&mdash;Every portion
of this plant is poisonous. The seeds are frequently
eaten by children, and give rise to vomiting
and purging, with dilatation of the pupils,
rigors, rigid limbs, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Œnanthe crocata</i>, <i>Phellandrinum aquaticum</i>, <i>Æthusa
Cynapium</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, strictly speaking, belong to
this group.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Hellebore</span> (<i>Helleborus niger</i>) or <i>Christmas
Rose</i>, grows in shady woods, and bears a large
flower in January. The leaves and root when
eaten give rise to abdominal pain, vomiting and
purging, vertigo, cold sweats, and collapse, resembling
that of malignant cholera. An infusion of
this plant is sometimes administered by quacks to
destroy intestinal worms. It has proved fatal to
children under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Several other substances variously grouped for
the sake of convenience should come under this
heading.</p>

SPECIFIC ANIMAL IRRITANTS.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cantharides</span> (<i>Spanish Flies</i>).</h3>

<p class="p2">This poison is well known, and is usually administered
in the form of powder or tincture. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
former, twenty-four grains have destroyed life;
of the latter, one ounce. This poison has been
employed as an aphrodisiac and to induce abortion,
by persons ignorant of its dangerous effects.
This is, perhaps, the most frequent cause of poisoning
by cantharides. Applied externally it has
proved fatal, as in the case of a girl affected with
scabies, who anointed the whole of her body with
cantharides ointment in mistake for that of sulphur.
She died in five days, after suffering from
the symptoms of poisoning by cantharides.</p>

<p>It produces an acrid taste, vomiting, purging,
burning heat in the stomach, pain in the loins,
severe strangury, bloody urine, and priapism.
Then there is faintness with giddiness, the limbs
become rigid, and delirium with convulsions precede
death. Sometimes the matters ejected from
the stomach or passed in the stools contain shining
golden or green particles, the remains of the
wing cases of the beetles, which constitute the
drug, readily seen with a lens, or even with the
naked eye.</p>

<p>After death, marks of inflammation are found
in the alimentary canal, kidneys and bladder, and
the genital organs.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;The detection of Spanish flies, if taken
solid, depends mainly on the presence of the shining
particles already alluded to, in the stomach,
or in the vomited matters. To make their nature
certain, however, an extract of the suspected materials
should be prepared and treated repeatedly
with chloroform or ether. This fluid is to be
allowed to evaporate till only a few drops are left,
which may be applied on lint to some portion of
the body where the skin is fine, as the fore arm,
the part being covered by a bit of isinglass plaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
or goldbeaters’ skin. The vesication produced is
the test of the presence of cantharides.</p>

<p>No antidote is known. Vomiting must be excited
or encouraged; and linseed tea, and gum
water, or gruel copiously administered. The
warm bath will afford great relief. Oil must be
avoided, on account of its being a solvent of the
active principle (cantharidine) of this poison.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

NARCOTICS.</h2>

<h3>NEUROTICS, ACTING ON THE BRAIN AND PRODUCING
SLEEP.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Opium.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Opium</span> is the inspissated juice of the unripe capsules
of the <i>Papaver somniferum</i>, or white poppy,
and is a very complex substance. Its principal
properties, however, are due to the presence of
<i>morphia</i>, as meconate of morphia; but others of
its constituent substances undoubtedly modify its
action.</p>

<p>It is sometimes used as a poison in its crude
state, but more frequently in solution in alcohol,
forming tincture of opium, or laudanum. Unfortunately,
opium is the powerful ingredient of most
soothing syrups for children, to whom opium is
at all times especially dangerous; and many who
do not die from its direct effects, do from the wasting
indirectly produced.</p>

<p>Of domestic quieting physic the chief preparations
are Godfrey’s Cordial, supposed to consist
of one grain of opium in two ounces; and Dalby’s
Carminative, which is one-fourth weaker.</p>

<p>The smallest quantity of <i>laudanum</i> which is
known to have proved fatal to an adult is two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
drachms, from which death occurred within twelve
hours. The exact quantity taken was, however,
doubtful. Two grains and a half of the <i>extract</i>, a
quantity said to be equal to four grains of crude
opium, have produced a similar result. Much
larger doses are, however, taken with impunity on
many occasions, more especially by those habituated
to the use of this drug, who remain almost
unaffected by surprisingly large quantities. De
Quincey, the English opium-eater, once found in
a pirated edition of &#8220;Buchan’s Domestic Medicine,&#8221;
a caution against taking more than &#8220;twenty-five
<i>ounces</i>&#8221; of laudanum at one dose. He says
that he always bore this <i>excellent</i> advice in mind;
and it does not appear that he ever took more
than sixteen ounces of the tincture of opium as
his daily allowance. In certain diseases, patients
quite unaccustomed to the use of sedatives can
take excessive amounts without narcotism being
produced. In some cases of tetanus, for example,
upwards of four ounces of laudanum have been
given daily for a week, without any marked effect.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that
not a few individuals are unable to take even one-third
of a grain without being narcotised. Young
children are particularly susceptible of its effects;
the tenth and twelfth parts of a grain having respectively
proved fatal to infants two and five
days old. Dr. Edward Smith has even recorded
the case of an infant seven days old, who died
comatose eighteen hours after having had administered
to it about the twelfth of a grain of opium,
or the quantity contained in one drop of laudanum.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
The smallest fatal dose for a child on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
record is one of paregoric elixir equivalent to
about one-<i>ninetieth</i> of a grain of opium. On the
other hand, they sometimes recover from very
large doses indeed.</p>

<p>The duration of a fatal case is generally from
seven to twelve hours. The shortest period recorded
is three-quarters of an hour; the longest,
twenty-four hours. If the patient survives twelve
hours there is good hope of recovery.</p>

<p>The quantity of <span class="smcap">Morphia</span> found in opium varies
from two to ten per cent. The chief salts of this
alkaloid are the <i>acetate</i>, the <i>hydrochlorate</i>, and the
<i>sulphate</i>, all being very energetic poisons. They
cause symptoms similar to those about to be described
as produced by opium. But, in addition,
there has been especially noticed great itching of
the skin, convulsive twitchings of the muscles of
the face and limbs, and occasionally tetanus.
Small doses of any of the salts of morphia may
cause death. In a delicate woman half a grain is
supposed to have proved fatal; in several instances
one grain has proved fatal; and certainly a dose
of two grains might kill a healthy adult unaccustomed
to opiates. Nevertheless, under the influence
of custom, large quantities may be taken. A
young lady, who has long been under notice, has
for the last three years taken daily fifteen grains
of the hydrochlorate of morphia, without obtaining
more than two or three hours’ sleep from it;
while for many days in succession, when suffering
much pain, she increases the quantity to one
scruple. From attempts to diminish the dose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
made without the patient’s knowledge, only mischief
has resulted.</p>

<p>Others of the opium alkaloids are poisonous;
but instances of poisoning by their means have
not occurred, except one doubtful instance of
poisoning by narcotine, recorded by Sonnenschein.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;When a large dose of opium or its
tincture has been taken the symptoms usually
manifest themselves in about twenty or thirty
minutes. They commence with giddiness, drowsiness,
and stupor; then ensues insensibility. The
patient appears as if in a sound sleep, from which
he can be roused by a loud noise, &amp;c., although
he quickly relapses. As the poisoning progresses
the breathing becomes slow and stertorous, the
pulse weak and feeble, and the countenance livid.
The eyes are closed, while the pupils are generally
contracted, often almost to the size of a pin’s
point, and insensible to the stimulus of light. In
some instances the skin is cold and livid, in others
it is bathed in sweat. So also the countenance
may be either ghastly or placid, the pupils may
even be dilated, and the pulse may be unaffected,
or so small and frequent as to be scarcely appreciable.
Vomiting sometimes occurs, with slight
reaction, so that hopes of recovery are entertained.
But frequently there is a relapse, the comatose
state returns, and death quickly follows, occasionally
preceded by convulsions.</p>

<p>The possibility of rousing a patient during the
earlier portion of the progress of these symptoms
will assist in diagnosing the effects of poisoning by
opium from those due to apoplexy, epilepsy, &amp;c.
The contracted condition of the pupil will also
assist; but it must not be forgotten that in lesion
of the pons Varolii the pupils are also contracted.
When permanent recovery ensues it is complete;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
but it is usually preceded for a day or two by
severe nausea, a sense of weariness, constipation,
and headache.</p>

<p>The habitual use of opium is most injurious.
Dr. Oppenheim, in his description of the state of
medicine in Turkey, tells us that persons seldom
attain the age of forty who have begun the practice
early. The opium-eater may be known by
his attenuated body, withered yellow countenance,
stooping posture, and glassy, sunken eyes. He
has no appetite, his bodily powers are destroyed,
and he is obliged continually to increase the dose
of his &#8220;grief-assuaging remedy&#8221; to obtain the
wished-for effect.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem appearances.</i>&mdash;The appearances in
acute poisoning by opium are not very characteristic.
The most prominent are, great turgescence
of the vessels of the brain, with effusion of serum
into the ventricles and at the base. The turgid
condition of the vessels often continues down the
spinal cord, &amp;c. The lungs are usually gorged
with fluid blood, and the skin is of a livid hue.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The first object is to remove all the
poison from the stomach, and this cannot be
effected in any way so well as by the stomach-pump.
In the absence of this instrument, emetics
of half a drachm of sulphate of zinc, or a tablespoonful
of mustard, must be employed. The
patient at the same time is to be prevented as far
as possible from going to sleep. When the stomach has
been thoroughly emptied, every means
must be adopted to keep the patient roused.
This is to be effected by dashing cold water over
his head and chest, walking him up and down or
shaking him between two attendants in the open
air, irritating his legs by flagellation with a wet
towel, applying electro-magnetic shocks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
spine, and administering strong coffee. Bleeding
has been recommended; but it is only to be used
after the poison has been removed from the stomach,
and when from the coma and full pulse we
are sure that there is cerebral congestion. In extreme
cases artificial respiration must be tried.</p>

<p>The remedies recommended must be perseveringly
used, remembering that as long as life lasts
hope of recovery is not to be banished. In the
great majority of cases the treatment is successful.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;There are no direct means by which
opium may be detected. We endeavor therefore
to obtain evidence of the presence of morphia and
meconic acid. The two substances may be separated
from organic admixture by the following
process: The suspected matters should be well
boiled with distilled water, and spirit acidulated
with acetic acid, and strained. To the fluid which
has passed through, acetate of lead is to be added
until precipitation ceases, and the whole, after
standing, is to be thrown on a filter. The insoluble
meconate of lead remains on the filter, the
morphia passing through as acetate. To separate
the meconic acid the substance on the filter is to
be diffused through water, and sulphuretted
hydrogen passed for a time. Sulphide of lead is
thus thrown down and may be separated by filtration,
the meconic acid remaining in solution. On
concentration this should give the requisite reactions.</p>

<p>In the search for morphia the filtered fluid above
referred to is also to be treated with sulphuretted
hydrogen, to secure the precipitation of all acetate
of lead, &amp;c., which is next to be carefully separated
from it by further filtration. The fluid now
passing through, containing the acetate of morphia,
is next to be concentrated by evaporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
over a water bath, and carefully neutralized by
bicarbonate of potass, if it be desired to obtain
the pure alkaloid; but this is not necessary, as
the acetate responds to all reagents. The acetate
may be dissolved out of the mass in dilute alcohol
(it is not soluble in ether), again filtered, the filtrate
being finally evaporated to dryness and
tested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morphia.</span>&mdash;The best tests for this alkaloid, in
substance or in solution (substance is preferable)
are:</p>

<p>1. Nitric acid, which strikes an orange red color,
varying in intensity with the strength of the acid
and the concentration of the morphia solution.
Ruddy fumes are also developed.</p>

<p>2. Neutral perchloride of iron, strikes a rich
blue color with morphia when added in small
quantity; if added in excess, the yellow of the test,
combining with the blue, may produce a green.
This blue is destroyed by acids and by heat.
Nitric acid not only destroys the blue produced
by this test, but replaces it with the orange-red
color; so that the nitric acid test may be applied
to the same portion of morphia after the iron test,
but not <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>3. Iodic acid. This acid becomes decomposed,
owing to the reducing action of morphia, setting
free the iodine. The latter is detected by its brown
color, and the blue which it strikes with starch.
The iodic acid should be previously tested to ascertain
its purity, as it occasionally contains free
iodine.</p>

<p>4. Bichromate of potassium gives a green with
morphia, passing to a dingy brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meconic Acid.</span>&mdash;This is obtained from solutions
of opium, in the form of little scaly crystals of a
reddish tint, which are decomposed by heat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
partly sublimed. In solution it may be detected
by its acquiring a blood-red color on the addition
of the perchloride of iron. A similar color is produced
by sulphocyanide of potassium, as found in
the saliva; but the color of the meconate is not
discharged by chloride of gold; the sulphocyanide
is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Narcotine</span> dissolves in sulphuric acid with a
yellow color, converted into a carmine red by the
addition of a trace of nitric acid.</p>

ANÆSTHETICS.</h2>

<h3>NEUROTICS ACTING ON THE BRAIN AND PRODUCING
INSENSIBILITY.</h3>

<h4>CHLOROFORM&mdash;CHLORAL&mdash;BICHLORIDE OF METHYLENE&mdash;ETHER&mdash;AMYLENE&mdash;NITROUS
OXIDE.</h4>

<p class="p2">The anæsthetics which have hitherto been employed
in the practice of medicine are chloroform,
sulphuric ether (or a mixture of these), bichloride
of methylene and nitrous oxide, and amylene.
Any of these agents may cause death when introduced
into the system by inhalation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloroform</span> is a colorless, heavy, volatile
liquid; having a fruity ethereal odor and a sweet
pungent taste. It is formed by the union of
chlorine and marsh gas, but more commonly by
the action of bleaching powder on ethylic or
methylic alcohol. It is readily soluble in alcohol,
but very sparingly so in water. Chloroform is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
good solvent of caoutchouc, gutta-percha, camphor,
wax, resin, some of the alkaloids, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> produced by the vapor of chloroform
may be divided into three groups of varying
intensity; briefly they are these: First, a degree
of relief from pain, the senses being but slightly
affected; second, a stage of excitement and incoherence,
wherein the patient is prone to struggle;
and thirdly, a stage of which the most marked
features are complete insensibility and narcotism,
with relaxation of the muscular system. At first
the patient is conscious of all that is passing
around him, but there is dizziness and singing in
the ears. Then the mental functions are impaired,
there is often excitement, the saliva is increased,
the patient pushes away the inhaler, rigidity and
spasms of the muscles may occur, and there is incoherent
talk. In the next stage there is insensibility
to pain, and the conjunctiva may be touched
without causing flinching. If the use of this
anæsthetic be pushed further the breathing becomes
stertorous, the muscles quite relaxed, and
the pupils dilated; while a still further increase
of the chloroform embarrasses and then stops the
breathing and arrests the heart’s action.</p>

<p>Many cases of death from the vapor of chloroform
have occurred, the fatal effect sometimes
happening very rapidly from shock, syncope, or
convulsions. The vapor of only thirty drops has
destroyed life in one minute. Death under the
influence of chloroform must not be confounded
with death from its effects. The smallest fatal
dose when the drug has been swallowed is one
drachm in a boy aged four.</p>

<p>The effects of chloroform taken by the mouth
are of the same description as those which follow
the inhalation of this agent; with this exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
that the fatal result seems to be longer deferred.
A case reported in the <i>Medical Times and Gazette</i>,
10th May, 1862, illustrates the symptoms, &amp;c., in
a clear way. Mr. M., thirty-four years of age, a
highly-gifted restless man, was in the habit of inhaling
chloroform on account of sleeplessness. He
was very sensitive to its action. At about 12.30
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> on the 7th October, 1861, he drank some
chloroform; the quantity being uncertain, though
it may be inferred that it was about one ounce.
At 7.15 he was in such a profound sleep that his
wife felt uneasy, and she sent for Dr. Axel Lamm.
This gentleman found his patient in a tranquil
sleep, the respiration being somewhat hurried and
audible, the pulse full but slow, the body warm,
and the pupils dilated and insensible. There was
a perceptible smell of chloroform in the breath and
in the air of the room. The window was opened,
ice was applied to the head, cold affusions were
used along the spine, and an enema was administered.
At 9.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, the patient was paler, breathing
less audibly, and with a weaker pulse. Artificial
respiration was employed by means of electricity,
an ammonia lavement was given, and aspersions
of iced water to the chest and pit of the stomach
were used alternately with warm coverings. The
stupor continued, the respired air smelt distinctly
of chloroform, the abdomen was tympanitic, and
the pupils began to contract. About 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> the
eyes began to move, the pupils seemed sensible to
light, the pulse was 160, there was abundant perspiration,
and the patient sat up for a few moments
and looked surprised. Exhaustion, however, set
in, and death occurred just before midnight, nearly
twenty-four hours after swallowing the poison.</p>

<p>A second interesting case (<i>Medical Times and
Gazette</i>, 31st May, 1862) also deserves attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
A gentleman, fifty years of age, swallowed two
ounces of pure chloroform at 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> He was not
seen until 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, when he was found in a state of
deep coma. His breath smelt strongly of chloroform,
the pupils were widely dilated and insensible,
the pulse slow and feeble, the surface colder
than natural, the movements of the thorax scarcely
perceptible, and sensation generally abolished.
Ammonia, sinapisms, bottles of hot water, and
cold affusion did no good; but on using a stomach-pump
a quantity of chloroform mixed with watery
mucus was withdrawn, and in less than an hour
the patient was able to answer questions. For
three or four days he complained of a burning
sensation in the throat and epigastrium, and then
got well. A consideration of the treatment employed
in this instance cannot but suggest the idea
that the first patient might have had a better
chance of recovery had the stomach-pump been
used when Dr. Lamm was first called in; though
it is difficult to conceive how any quantity of chloroform
could remain in the stomach for seven
hours, without all of it being absorbed.</p>

<p>Various plans have been suggested for the administration
of chloroform with safety, but this
must be remembered: the use of anæsthetics is at
all times attended with risk, and we can only at
best diminish the danger. Apparatus may be used
so as to reduce the risk to a minimum; but this
is plain, any contrivance which in itself requires
much attention, and thereby diverts it from the
patient, is bad. More lives have been lost by
bungling in its administration than from the noxious
character of the drug.</p>

<p>In the <i>treatment</i> of poisoning by the vapor of
any of the anæsthetics mentioned in this chapter,
we must expose the patient to a current of pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
air, use cold affusion, and employ artificial respiration
until the poison is eliminated. Galvanism
may be employed to keep up the action of the
diaphragm, either directly or through the phrenics.
As these agents are got rid of through the lungs,
the purity of the expired air is one test of the
elimination being complete; though of course inferior
to the evidence afforded by the subsidence
of the symptoms. In poisoning by liquid chloroform
or ether the stomach-pump ought to be
promptly used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloral Hydrate</span>, which with an alkali is converted
into chloroform, has of late been much
used as a narcotic and for easing pain. No details
of any case of poisoning by its agency have yet
been published.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bichloride of Methylene</span> has been used for
anæsthetic purposes. It is supposed to be safer
than chloroform. Practically they act much alike,
and death happens with the one as with the other.</p>

<p><i>Test.</i>&mdash;Chloroform at a red heat is decomposed,
and chlorine and hydrochloric acid are formed.
Hence, to detect it the substance supposed to contain
it may be heated so as to expel the chloroform,
which should be conducted away from it by
a tube at right angles; to this heat should be applied
sufficient to decompose the vapor, and its
products searched for by the ordinary tests. The
smell is a valuable criterion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphuric Ether.</span>&mdash;Sulphuric ether, or ether, is
a clear colorless liquid, very inflammable, soluble
in alcohol, and less so in water. It is usually obtained
by distilling common alcohol with sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p>The effects produced by the inhalation of ether
are similar to those which result from chloroform.
It is, however, without doubt a much safer agent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
but its effects are longer in manifesting themselves;
it is more irritating to the air-passages,
and much more of it is required. Deaths have
occurred under its influence as under that of
chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amylene.</span>&mdash;This is a colorless, volatile liquid,
made by distilling amylic alcohol (obtained from
crude fusel oil, or oil of potato spirit) with chloride
of zinc.</p>

<p>Dr. Snow found that amylene, like chloroform,
is capable of causing sudden death by inducing
over-narcotism of the heart, and paralysis of this
organ. He had two deaths from it, and it has
since been entirely given up as an anæsthetic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nitrous Oxide.</span>&mdash;Comparatively recently the
laughing gas of Sir Humphrey Davy has been
introduced as an anæsthetic agent. Its successful
use depends on the total exclusion of air from the
lungs during its exhibition. It can only be used
for a short time, hence it is chiefly employed in
dental operations, although it has been given for
a considerable length of time consecutively by
allowing the patient to return to the verge of sensibility
before giving a fresh dose.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h3>NEUROTICS ACTING ON THE BRAIN AND PRODUCING
INTOXICATION.</h3>

<h4>ALCOHOL&mdash;NITRO-BENZOLE&mdash;COCCULUS INDICUS&mdash;FUNGI,
ETC.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Alcohol.</span>&mdash;Spiritous liquors, when taken in
large quantities, not unfrequently produce fatal
effects.</p>

<p>Two wineglassfuls of brandy proved fatal to a
boy, seven years old, in thirty hours. Dr. Taylor
mentions the case of a man who drank two bottles
of port wine (containing eleven ounces of alcohol)
in less than two hours. He speedily became intoxicated
and utterly helpless, never rallied, and
died from congestion of the brain and lungs.
Another man who swallowed a bottle of gin for a
wager died in half an hour, although much of the
spirit was removed by the stomach-pump. A
common cause of acute alcohol poisoning is
&#8220;sucking the monkey,&#8221; as practised in the docks
by laborers having access to spirit casks.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms</i> generally come on rapidly, the
individual appearing confused, and unable to walk
steadily. This degree of intoxication soon passes
into the stage of complete stupor and coma, and
unless there is vomiting collapse soon sets in. In
some cases a remission of the symptoms has
occurred, death being postponed for a day or
longer.</p>

<p>As the alcohol is eliminated by the lungs, stupor
from drink may be detected by the odor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
breath. The countenance is usually flushed, and
the pupils are dilated, but in cases of acute
poisoning the patient may be deadly pale. The
pupils are not contracted, as in poisoning by
opium; moreover, the individual may generally
be roused for a few moments by a loud noise, &amp;c.;
a circumstance which may prevent intoxication
being mistaken for concussion of the brain.</p>

<p>Diluted spirits produce a state of excitement,
terminating in stupor. It must be remembered
that alcoholic liquids have been frequently made
the vehicles of more virulent poisons.</p>

<p>As regards <i>treatment</i>, it is only necessary to say
that the poison is to be removed as quickly as
possible by the stomach-pump. Cold affusion
should be employed, and the diluted liquor ammoniæ,
or carbonate of ammonia, administered.
Subsequently warmth must be promoted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nitro-Benzole and Aniline.</span>&mdash;A compound,
made from the rectified products of coal tar and
nitric acid, and known as <i>nitro-benzole</i>, is sometimes
used as a substitute for essential oil of
almonds. It is sold to perfumers under the name
of &#8220;essence of mirbane.&#8221; A lad employed in some
chemical works in the early part of 1862, finding
a syphon did not act, sucked through it some of
the fluid, which happened to be nitro-benzole.
No immediate effect resulted, but in a few hours
he felt as if he were drunk. Stupor came on, and
ended in death twelve hours after swallowing the
poison. Another product of the destructive distillation
of coal in gas-making is <i>aniline</i> (into
which nitro-benzole is converted in the human
body) a colorless, limpid, acrid, and poisonous
liquid. It has given rise to very alarming symptoms
when swallowed, as well as when inhaled in
vapor. It produces a remarkable blue or purple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
discoloration of the body, particularly the lips
and nails.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cocculus Indicus.</span>&mdash;The kernel of the berry of
the Menispermum cocculus, or Levant nut, imported
from the East Indies, contains from one to
two per cent. of a poisonous principle named
<i>picrotoxine</i>. Thieves sometimes mix a decoction
or extract of the berries with spirits or beer, to
give these drinks an intoxicating property (hocussing).
Dishonest publicans, too, first reduce their
beer by means of salt and water, and afterwards
give it intoxicating properties by adding cocculus
extract. The same substance is used by poachers
to destroy fish. The symptoms produced appear
to be a peculiar stupor, a complete loss of voluntary
power, with a consciousness of passing
events.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darnel Seeds</span> (<i>Lolium temulentum</i>).&mdash;The seeds
of this plant, which is often found growing with
corn crops, when accidentally mixed in considerable
quantity with wheat or rye, and ground into
flour, have caused gastric pain, severe giddiness,
vomiting, and other symtoms of intoxication.
The sufferers complained that everything seemed
of a green color. A wet season is said to encourage
the growth of darnel with the varieties of
corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camphor.</span>&mdash;This substance is very variable in
its action. It has given rise to alarming symptoms
on some occasions, and once it has destroyed
life. In scruple and half-drachm doses, it seems
to have produced giddiness, difficulty in walking,
dimness of sight, difficulty of breathing, delirium,
and insensibility.</p>

<p>The stomach-pump or emetics must be employed.
If the effects are not very severe they
will generally cease spontaneously after a time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
The odor would lead to the detection of the
poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fungi.</span>&mdash;According to Berkeley there are now
upwards of 2380 recognised species of British
fungi, a considerable proportion of which are
doubtless poisonous. But the type of the class
may be taken as the Amanita muscaria. This is
an autumn fungus of an orange-red color, and is
used among the Siberian tribes, especially the
Koraks, as an intoxicating agent, and produces
symptoms somewhat similar to those of alcohol.</p>

<p>The Agaricus campestris and esculentus are
those most frequently used as articles of food, on
account of their savory properties; but even these
are indigestible. They occasionally produce diarrhœa,
with a pruriginous or exanthematous rash
in dyspeptics; and should only be eaten in great
moderation.</p>

<p><i>Ketchup</i>, the juice of the mushroom flavored
with salt and spices, has produced faintness,
nausea and colic, lasting for some hours.</p>

<p>There are some positive characters by which
the wholesome fungi can be distinguished from
the unwholesome. Moreover those which may be
eaten with impunity by some individuals prove
destructive to others. Thus, a French officer and
his wife died from breakfasting off mushrooms
which others in the house ate without inconvenience.
As a general rule highly colored mushrooms,
with an astringent styptic taste, a forbidding
pungent odor, and which grow in dark and
shady places, should be avoided.</p>

<p>The symptoms produced by poisonous fungi are
not unfrequently those indicative of gastro-intestinal
irritation, with a disordered condition of
the nervous system, and considerable depression;
but, again, they may act much more like pure nar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>cotics.
In treating these case, the stomach and
intestines must be thoroughly emptied, and then
the prominent symptoms are to be relieved according
to their urgency.</p>

DELIRANTS.</h2>

<h3>NEUROTICS ACTING ON THE BRAIN AND PRODUCING
DELIRIUM.</h3>

<h4>HYOSCYAMUS&mdash;BELLADONNA&mdash;STRAMONIUM&mdash;DATURA
ALBA&mdash;NIGHTSHADE.</h4>

<p class="p2">Most of these are not very important substances,
as they have rarely been employed as poisons in
this country. Serious symptoms have, however,
resulted from their accidental use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henbane</span> (<i>Hyoscyamus niger</i>).&mdash;All parts of this
plant are poisonous; but the seeds are more
powerful than the root or leaves. In medicinal
doses it is a feeble narcotic. It owes its powers
to an alkaloid (<i>hyoscyamia</i>) it contains.</p>

<p>In very large doses henbane produces giddiness,
flushings, excitement, and a sense of weight in
the head; the limbs tremble, and there is general
loss of power, the pupils get dilated, there is
double vision, flashing of light before the eyes,
and great drowsiness. If vomiting supervene
these symptoms generally pass off; otherwise we
may find fierce delirium, loss of speech, complete
loss of power over the limbs, cold sweats, and
exhaustion.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>In some instances, when the roots have been
eaten by mistake for parsnips, the symptoms have
been those of drunkenness and delirium. Dr.
Houlton states (<i>Lancet</i>, 6th July, 1844) that this
error was committed one night at a monastery.
The monks who partook of the roots had such
hallucinations that the establishment resembled a
lunatic asylum. They rang the bell for matins at
midnight, and those who attended were unable to
read, or they read that which was not in the book.
In another reported case (<i>Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal</i>,
p. 562, October, 1844), the roots were put into
soup, of which nine persons partook. Although
no unpleasant flavor was noticed at the time of
eating, yet very shortly afterwards all complained
of an acrid taste, nausea, indistinctness of vision,
restlessness, delirium, and great somnolency,
which continued some time.</p>

<p>The appearances found after death consist
chiefly of great congestion of the venous system.
The lungs and brain have especially been found
loaded with dark-colored blood.</p>

<p>To prevent a fatal result from the use of henbane
or others of this group, we must trust to
stimulant emetics, as sulphate of zinc, and full
doses of castor oil, so as to get rid of the offending
substance.</p>

<p><i>Test.</i>&mdash;The only test for hyoscyamus is the
botanical characters of the plant, when taken in
substance, and its power (common to all in
this group) of dilating the pupil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atropa Belladonna</span> (<i>Deadly Nightshade</i>).&mdash;Two
other plants known under the name of Nightshade
will hereafter be referred to. The Deadly Nightshade,
now to be noticed, is indigenous, and
grows in woods and gardens. The root, leaves,
and berries are poisonous, this property being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
due to the presence of an alkaloidal principle&mdash;<i>Atropia</i>.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;Dryness of the mouth and throat,
thirst which nothing allays, nausea and vomiting,
great dilatation of the pupils with indistinct or
double vision, giddiness, palpitation of the heart,
physical and mental depression, perversion of the
sense of taste, and delirium followed by stupor,
form the chief symptoms. They may set in within
from half an hour to three or four hours of swallowing
the poison. Sometimes strangury and
bloody urine, a scarlatinal kind of rash upon the
skin, a disposition to laugh and talk wildly, fanciful
delusions, a rapid flow of ideas, and difficulty
in walking, have been observed.</p>

<p>A large detachment of French soldiers, halting
near Dresden, ate freely of the belladonna berries.
Shortly afterwards they were seized with nausea,
thirst, dryness of the throat, difficult deglutition,
insensibility of the eye, great dilatation of the
pupil, delirium, and coma. Many of the men died
before assistance could be rendered to them.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;Congestion of the
cerebral vessels, dilated pupils, red patches at
different parts of the alimentary canal, and a
dyed purple hue of the gastric mucous membrane,
if the berries have been eaten, are the most common
appearances.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Stimulant emetics, castor oil, and
animal charcoal are the remedies to trust to.</p>

<p>Dr. Taylor refers to one case in which a young
man poisoned himself with two grains of <i>atropia</i>.
He took the dose on going to bed, was heard to
snore heavily during the night, and was found
dead at seven o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>As a means of diagnosing poisoning by belladonna
it has been recommended to introduce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
few drops of urine into the eye of an animal, to
see if dilatation of the pupil takes place.</p>

<p><i>Test.</i>&mdash;There is no very certain test for <i>Atropia</i>
beyond its effect on the pupils and on vision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stramonium</span> (<i>Datura Stramonium</i>, <i>Thorn-Apple</i>)
is an indigenous plant found in waste places. The
fruit and seeds are the most poisonous parts of
the plant. The active alkaloid, named Daturia,
has properties resembling those of atropia, with
which it would seem to be almost identical.</p>

<p>The poisonous effects of stramonium are the
same as those of belladonna, and are to be relieved
by similar remedies. When this drug is
prescribed as a medicine it should be immediately
discontinued if it produce dryness of the throat
and dilatation of the pupils.</p>

<p><i>Dhatoora.</i>&mdash;In India the seeds of the Datura
alba, a plant which grows abundantly in most
parts, are frequently used for the purpose of
hocussing travellers, in order that they may be
robbed with impunity. The seeds, which closely
resemble those of the capsicum, are mixed with
food, and give rise to total insensibility on the
part of the recipient, often with noisy delirium or
delusions. Death is not unfrequent after a large
dose, although it would seldom seem to be administered
for that purpose. Its effect may be for the
time being to completely alter the disposition of
the individual, and to cause him to give way to all
kinds of foolish notions and antics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nightshade.</span>&mdash;The <i>Solarium dulcamara</i> (Bittersweet,
or Woody Nightshade) and the <i>Solanum
nigrum</i> (Garden Nightshade) contain an active
principle known as Solania. The red berries of
the first-named plant, and the black berries of the
second, have been eaten by mistake; and have
given rise to great thirst, headache, giddiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
dimness of vision, dilated pupils, convulsions,
vomiting, and purging. Orfila relates the cases
of three children who died from eating the berries
of the Solanum nigrum, after suffering from vertigo,
dilated pupils, nausea, colic, stertorous
breathing, and convulsions.</p>

CONVULSIVES.</h2>

<h3>NEUROTICS PRODUCING CONVULSIONS.</h3>

<h4>NUX VOMICA&mdash;BRUCIA&mdash;STRYCHNIA.</h4>

<p class="p2">The plants which yield the alkaloid Strychnia
are, the <i>Strychnos nux vomica</i>, a native tree of
Coromandel, Ceylon and Bengal: the <i>Strychnos
Ignatii</i>, which abounds in the Philippine Islands,
and furnishes the hard seed, about the size of a
filbert, known as the bean of St. Ignatius; the
<i>Strychnos tieute</i>, a large climbing shrub of Java;
the <i>Strychnos toxifera</i>, of Guiana; and the <i>Strychnos
colubrina</i>, or <i>Snakewood</i>, of the East Indies.
The effects of these plants are exerted upon the
spinal cord; as is manifest by the violent convulsions
and the tetanic contractions of the muscles
which they produce. They have no effect on the
brain, consciousness remaining intact until death.</p>

<p>A powerful juice, used by the Indians of Guiana
as an arrow poison, and variously designated as
<i>curare</i>, <i>woorara</i>, &amp;c., is in all probability obtained
from the Strychnos toxifera. The composition of
the arrow poison varies in different tribes; in some
it is a mysterious compound of many substances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
obtained from plants, red and black ants, and the
fangs of venomous snakes; but in all the active
ingredient would seem to be the Strychnos toxifera.
It destroys the power of the motor nerves&mdash;an
action the reverse of that possessed by
strychnia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nux Vomica.</span>&mdash;A powder, a tincture, and an extract,
obtained from the seeds of the Strychnos
nux vomica, or koochla tree, are used in medical
practice. Thirty grains of the powder have proved
fatal, and so have three grains of the alcoholic
extract. Death may occur in from fifteen minutes
to twelve hours. It is possible that nux vomica
may accumulate in the system, as serious symptoms
have arisen from the long-continued use of
small doses. Thus a lady took nine grains of the
powder daily, in divided doses, for sixteen days.
As purging then set in with colic, the medicine
was withdrawn. Five days after the withdrawal
there was ringing in the ears, with drowsiness,
impairment of speech, &amp;c.; on the ninth day
tetanic symptoms set in, with trismus; and on the
twelfth day, after several tetanic convulsions,
death took place from exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brucia.</span>&mdash;The seeds of the nux vomica not only
yield strychnia but brucia, an alkaloid which has
the same properties, and causes the same symptoms
as strychnia, though it is much less powerful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strychnia.</span>&mdash;This alkaloid may very justly be
termed a deadly poison. It is unfortunately the
active ingredient of some preparations sold to the
public for destroying vermin: a circumstance
which has now led to the death of several individuals.
&#8220;Battle’s Vermin Killer&#8221; is said by Dr.
Letheby to consist of flour, Prussian blue, sugar,
and strychnia in the proportion of twenty-three per
cent. Since the use of strychnia by those notori<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ous
criminals Palmer and Dove, this formidable
agent has been employed by other murderers.</p>

<p>The medicinal dose of strychnia is from the
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub>th to the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub>th of a grain twice a day. Dr.
Christison communicated a case to Dr. Taylor in
which the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>th of a grain caused the death in four
hours of a child between two and three years of
age. One quarter of a grain has nearly proved
fatal to adults. A woman twenty-two years of age
died in the Jersey Hospital, from the accidental
administration of half a grain. Death has occurred
in twenty minutes from this poison. In eleven
cases analyzed by Dr. Guy two hours and three-quarters
were the limits respectively.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;The time at which the symptoms
commence varies according as the strychnia has
been taken in solution or in a pill. In the first
case a very bitter taste is experienced during
swallowing, usually followed in a few minutes by
a sense of suffocation and difficulty of breathing.
Then there are twitchings of the muscles, jerking
movements of the limbs, and a quivering of the
whole frame. The limbs become rigid, the head
is bent back, while the body is stiffened and
arched, so that it rests on the head and heels
(opisthotonos). The difficulty of breathing causes
the face to become dusky, the eyeballs prominent,
and the lips livid. The features assume a peculiar
grin (risus sardonicus); there is much thirst, but
perhaps inability to drink from spasm of the jaws;
while the sufferer is quite conscious, is much
alarmed, and is impressed with the idea that death
is surely stealing upon him. As the attacks of
spasms are commencing the patient cries out, and
warns those about him of the approach of the
seizure; he begs for help, and perhaps asks to be
held, or rubbed, or turned over; and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
seizure passes off, at the end of forty or sixty
seconds, he is exhausted, and bathed in sweat.
The more he is disturbed or excited the shorter is
the intervals between the attacks; and though a
firm grasp seems to afford relief, yet a slight touch,
a gust of air, or opening a door, will increase the
suffering. As death approaches the tetanic spasms
rapidly succeed each other; and the patient sinks,
suffocated during an attack, or exhausted during
an interval, in about two hours from the beginning
of the symptoms.</p>

<p>When the strychnia has been taken in a pill two
hours have elapsed before any effects have been
produced. A case is also reported (<i>Glasgow Medical
Journal</i>, July, 1856) where a medical man took
three grains of strychnia dissolved in spirits of
wine and diluted sulphuric acid. He went to bed
and slept for an hour and a half, and then awoke
with a spasm. Under treatment he recovered.</p>

<p>There is commonly a wide difference between
tetanus arising from a wound or from disease and
that provoked by strychnia. In the former case
some exciting cause can be detected; the symptoms
come on gradually, and only attain their full development
at the end of several hours; the rigidity
of the muscles is more or less permanent, there
being no intervals of relaxation as there are in
poisoning; and death has hardly been known to
occur in less than twenty-four hours, while frequently
it is deferred for two or three days.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;Although the body
may be relaxed at the time of death it usually quickly
stiffens&mdash;frequently in the course of ten or fifteen
minutes. The rigor mortis is persistent for some
time: in the case of Cook, poisoned by Palmer,
the rigidity of the body and limbs was said not
to have passed off after two months’ interment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
This is not however invariable, as a body may be
flaccid or stiff after death from this cause as from
any other. The hands are often clenched, and
the soles of the feet arched and inverted. The
membranes of the brain and of the upper part of
the spinal cord are congested; and there is often
considerable serous effusions under the spinal
arachnoid. The lungs are generally loaded with
dark fluid blood. The heart is usually contracted,
but sometimes the right cavities are distended like
the pulmonary vessels. The blood has been found
black and liquid.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Emetics are to be given at once, and
repeated until very free vomiting is induced. If
the tetanic spasms have not commenced, the
stomach-pump ought to be used. Chloroform is
to be given to relieve spasm and pain, but the
patient should be disturbed as little as possible,
as the least thing induces the tetanic attack.
There is no very suitable antidote, but tannic
acid, in the form of green or black tea, &amp;c., might
be given.</p>

<p>Iodine forms a crystallizable compound with
strychnia. Dr. Bennett, of Sydney, has recorded
an instance in which he attributed recovery to the
employment of tincture of iodine. Hence from
thirty minims to a drachm of this tincture combined
with the iodide of potassium may be exhibited.
In its absence, three or four ounces of
animal charcoal, diffused through water, ought to
be given.</p>

<p>To prevent the spasms by paralyzing the motor
nerves, a solution of curare has been recommended
by Dr. George Harley to be injected
under the skin; or, if it could be obtained, the
active principle of this substance, curarina, would
perhaps be deserving of trial.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The patient is to be kept warm and quiet.</p>

<p>To separate strychnia from organic admixture
the process modified from Stas, given in the beginning
of this book, is the most useful.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;Strychnia is a white crystalline solid,
very insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol or
chloroform or weak acids, and having an intensely
bitter taste.</p>

<p>1. Pure strychnia is not changed in color when
treated with iodic acid or with either of the strong
mineral acids; but as this alkaloid generally contains
brucia, nitric acid reddens it.</p>

<p>2. Dissolved in sulphuric acid no change ensues;
but on adding a fragment of bichromate of potass
to the solution a series of blue, violet, purple and
red tints are produced. The same result is brought
about by using ferricyanide of potassium, permanganate
of potassium, the peroxide of lead, or the
black oxide of manganese.</p>

<p>3. If the skin of a frog be dried, and a few drops
of a solution containing strychnia applied to it,
strong tetanic convulsions will ensue, and be reproduced
every time the animal is touched or
irritated. According to Dr. Marshall Hall this
strychnoscopic test will detect the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5000</sub>th of a
grain, or even less.</p>

<p>4. An exceedingly useful class of tests for many
poisons has been introduced by Dr. Guy; we
mean the crystalline appearances presented on
subliming the substance and condensing it on a
cool microscopic slide, or the crystalline form observed
as modified by various reagents. Thus the
strychnine sublimate, touched with a drop of carbazotic
acid, forms groups of arborescent crystals,
each branch forming part of a circle, when seen
under the microscope.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

HYPOSTHENISANTS.</h2>

<h3>NEUROTICS PRODUCING DEATH BY SYNCOPE.</h3>

<h4>ACONITE&mdash;PRUSSIC ACID.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Aconite</span> (<i>Aconitum Napellus</i>, <i>Monkshood</i>, <i>Wolfsbane</i>,
<i>Blue Rocket</i>).&mdash;This beautiful plant is found
in most parts of Europe.</p>

<p><i>Aconitia</i>, the alkaloidal base of the plant, is the
most deadly poison known; the fiftieth part of a
grain having nearly caused death.</p>

<p>The chief <i>symptoms</i> of poisoning by aconite are
numbness and tingling in the mouth and throat,
giddiness, abolition of muscular power, pain in the
abdomen, with vomiting and purging. Sometimes
delirium and slight stupor have been noticed.
The pupils are usually dilated, the skin is cold,
the pulse exceedingly feeble, the breathing oppressed,
and there is a dread of approaching
dissolution. Frequently the sufferer is perfectly
conscious, though paralyzed, till death suddenly
occurs after two or three hurried gasps. According
to Dr. Fleming, death may be due to a sedative
impression on the nervous system, or to
asphyxia from paralysis of the respiratory muscles,
or to syncope.</p>

<p>A fatal mistake is not very uncommonly made
in eating the root of aconite for that of horseradish.
The sense of tingling and numbness produced
by the former is so different from the
pungent taste of the latter that with due care
no mistake should occur, except the plants be
allowed to grow together, which should never be
done.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>A case occurred in Ireland where a woman
poisoned one man and nearly killed another by
sprinkling powdered aconite root over a dish of
greens.</p>

<p>Of the root one drachm, of the tincture one
drachm, and of the alcoholic extract four grains,
have caused death. Death follows a considerable
dose in less than an hour, but sometimes a longer
period elapses.</p>

<p>The Bikh poison, formerly much used in India,
and still not unfrequently employed, has as its
basis the Aconitum ferox, a still more dangerous
drug than our indigenous plant.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;No time must be lost in the use of
remedies. In addition to emetics, castor oil, and
animal charcoal, benefit may be derived from administering
strong coffee. Brandy or ammonia
should also be given, while the limbs and back
are well rubbed with hot towels. Artificial respiration
might prove useful.</p>

<p>There is no good test for aconitia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrocyanic Acid</span> (<i>Prussia Acid</i>), on account of
its energetic and rapid action, is one of the most
formidable poisons with which we are acquainted.
In its concentrated state it is a limpid colorless
liquid; possessing a somewhat acrid taste, and
having an odor, when diffused through the air,
resembling that of oil of bitter almonds. When
diluted with water, it forms the acid kept by the
druggist. The properties of this variety are
similar to those of the pure form; except that, if
kept in the dark, it is not so readily decomposed.
It is in this condition that it is used as a poison.
The diluted acid of the British Pharmacopœia
contains about 2 per cent., and that known as
Scheele’s from 4 to 5 per cent., of the strong
acid; but all vary greatly with keeping.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the salts of hydrocyanic acid, the <i>cyanide
of potassium</i>, claims a short notice, since it is
largely employed by photographers, workers in
electrotype, &amp;c. It has been taken as a poison.
This salt is sold in the form of deliquescent white
crystals, or in crystalline masses, which are very
soluble in water, and possess the odor of prussic
acid. From three to five grains will destroy life
almost as rapidly as prussic acid itself, and in the
same manner: a dose of five grains has proved
fatal.</p>

<p>Several vegetable substances yield prussic acid,
such as the kernels of the peach, apricot, nectarine,
cherry, &amp;c., the leaves of the cherry laurel,
and the pips of apples and pears. Cases of alarming
illness have occurred from eating <i>bitter almonds</i>
too freely; while the essential oil obtained by
distilling the pulp of these almonds with water is
a powerful poison. This <i>essence</i> or <i>oil of bitter
almonds</i> contains about ten per cent. of anhydrous
prussic acid; and it is probable that from ten to
thirty drops would prove fatal to an adult. The
prussic acid may, however, be separated from it,
and leave the oil harmless.</p>

<p>A distilled water obtained from the leaves of
the cherry laurel, which was formerly employed
in medicine, proved dangerous from its very
variable strength; it has been used as a poison.
In the well-known case of Sir Theodosius Boughton,
poisoned by Captain Donellan in 1781, <i>laurel
water</i> produced death within half an hour after
two ounces had been swallowed.</p>

<p>The smallest quantity of prussic acid which has
been known to destroy life is nine-tenths of a
grain of the anhydrous acid, equal to forty-five
minims of the diluted preparation of the British
Pharmacopœia; and it is probable that this would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
in most instances, prove fatal. In the case referred
to death occurred in twenty minutes; but
from a larger dose it has ensued much earlier.
The period may be said to vary from two to five
and forty minutes. Insensibility may, however,
come on in a few seconds. In the case of seven
epileptics accidentally poisoned at the Bicêtre,
death occurred in the first within twenty minutes,
in the last after three-quarters of an hour, though
the dose of the acid was the same in each instance.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;These will vary with the dose and
the mode of exhibition. Inhalation of the vapor
of anhydrous prussic acid would immediately
cause death. The vapor of the diluted acid has
given rise to serious symptoms with great rapidity.
Scheele is said to have been suddenly killed by
respiring the vapor of the dilute acid while making
his experiments.</p>

<p>When the diluted acid is taken in a large dose
the symptoms may commence during swallowing,
death following so quickly that scarcely any
effects can be observed. The chief symptoms,
perhaps, are insensibility, slow gasping, or convulsive
respiration, a clammy cold skin, fixed and
glistening eyes, dilated pupils, spasmodic closure
of the jaws, an almost imperceptible pulse, and
sometimes convulsions of the limbs and trunk.
The rapidity with which consciousness is lost is
well exemplified in an instance recorded by Hufeland,
where a man about to be apprehended as a
thief took an ounce of the acid, staggered a few
steps and fell apparently lifeless. In a few moments
a single violent respiration was made, and
within five minutes of taking the poison he was
dead.</p>

<p>Insensibility is not, however, in all instances,
immediately produced; many an authenticated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
case having occurred in which the symptoms were
protracted for some minutes, the individual performing
several acts indicating consciousness,
such as replacing the cork in the bottle, adjusting
the bed-clothes, or even running some distance to
summon help.</p>

<p>The utterance of a shriek has been said to be
characteristic of poisoning by this acid; but toxicologists
know that such has not been observed in
the human subject, and that there is merely a
gasping for breath, or perhaps a call for help.</p>

<p>A small dose produces faintness, insensibility,
difficulty of breathing, involuntary evacuations,
loss of muscular power, convulsions, and temporary
paralysis. If the proper treatment be employed,
recovery may often be effected.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The body is generally
livid, the countenance pallid, or sometimes
livid and bloated, the jaws firmly closed, and the
hands clenched. There is frequently blood or
froth about the mouth, and the eyes are sometimes
described as prominent and glistening. There is
often an odor of prussic acid about the body,
which is more perceptible on opening the stomach.
The venous system is usually gorged with blood;
and the brain, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys
have been found congested with dark-colored
fluid blood.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;There is no chemical antidote to
this poison which can be relied upon. Chlorine
and the mixed oxides of iron have been recommended;
but even if one of these agents happened
to be at hand, it is doubtful if its employment
could be timely enough to be advantageous.
Attempts must be made to restore animation by
cold affusion, stimulating frictions to the chest
and abdomen, warmth to the surface, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
application of ammonia to the nostrils. Cold
affusion over the head and neck has proved most
efficacious when promptly resorted to, and repeated
at short intervals so as to cause a shock.
The direct injection of liquor ammoniæ into the
veins, as proposed by Professor Halford, for snake
bite, might be tried if the means were at hand.
As soon as possible ammonia should be given
internally and the stomach emptied.</p>

<p>If recovery ensue from the immediate effects,
vomiting should be produced by emetics or otherwise,
after which strong coffee, with brandy, ought
to be administered.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;The best are the following:</p>

<p>When hydrocyanic acid has to be separated
from organic substances, such as the contents of
the stomach, it is usual to take advantage of its
ready volatility. If the acid be not in combination
it may be given off so readily as to be detected by
a watch glass moistened with nitrate of silver held
over the vessel containing the acid; but in order
to make sure of its presence or absence the following
process should be adopted. The suspected
material should be acidulated with pure sulphuric
acid so as to insure the prussic acid being in a
free state. The substances thus acidulated are to
be placed in a retort, distilled over a water bath,
and the distillate collected in a cool receiver containing
some caustic potass. About one-sixth of
the fluid substance should in this way be distilled
over, when the liquid in the receiver may be tested
by the silver or iron tests, or the vapor as it
passes over may be tried with the sulphur test.</p>

<p>1. The peculiar <i>odor</i> of prussic acid is well
known, and is a very delicate test, taken in conjunction
with others, of its presence.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Silver Test.</i>&mdash;Nitrate of silver yields, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
hydrocyanic acid or cyanide of potassium, a white
clotted precipitate, (cyanide of silver,) insoluble
in cold but soluble in boiling nitric acid. If this
precipitate be well dried and heated, cyanogen gas
will be given off, which may be known by its
burning with a purplish flame. This test is very
delicate.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Iron Test.</i>&mdash;Of the liquid collected in the
receiver above-mentioned, or the suspected acid
liquid, saturated with a few drops of caustic potass,
a portion is to be taken, and to this is to be added
a small quantity of a solution of sulphate of iron.
A dirty brownish or greenish precipitate will fall,
consisting of a mixture of the oxide of iron and
prussian blue. On adding a few drops of diluted
sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, and thus dissolving
the oxides, the prussian blue will immediately
be made clear if hydrocyanic acid be present.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Copper Test.</i>&mdash;Sulphate of copper added
to prussic acid rendered slightly alkaline by potass,
gives a greenish-white precipitate, which becomes
white by the addition of a few drops of hydrochloric
acid to dissolve the blue precipitated oxide
of copper.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Sulphur Test.</i>&mdash;One of the most useful
tests for prussic acid, whether in the fluid or volatile
state, is the so-called sulphur or Liebig’s test.
It is best adapted for detecting the acid in a state
of vapor, and to this end a drop of yellow sulphide
of ammonium in a watch-glass is held over the
suspected liquid, which may be warmed by the
hand to facilitate the evolution of the acid. In
this position the watch-glass should be allowed to
remain for some little time, after which a drop of
solution of perchloride of iron is to be added, which
will give rise to a blood-red color not discharged
by corrosive sublimate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>If the acid is in the liquid form a drop of the
prussic acid and the yellow sulphide may be mixed
and heated until they thoroughly combine. A drop
of sulphate of iron is then added as before, but all
the sulphide must be decomposed or a black
sulphide of iron will be produced, even though
prussic acid be present, instead of the ordinary
blood-red color.</p>

<p>Other substances give a similar reaction with
iron; but their color is discharged by corrosive
sublimate.</p>

<h3>NEUROTICS PRODUCING MARKED DEPRESSION OF THE
HEART’S ACTION.</h3>

<h4>DIGITALIS&mdash;CALABAR BEAN&mdash;TOBACCO&mdash;HEMLOCK.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Digitalis Purpurea</span> (<i>Purple Foxglove</i>).&mdash;The
seeds, leaves, and root of this indigenous hedge-plant
are poisonous. <i>Digitalin</i> is the principle
which these parts contain. The officinal infusion
of digitalis, made from the dried leaves, is used in
doses of ʒij, ℥ss, or more; of the tincture m. v to
m. xl are usually given. On the recommendation
of the late Mr. Jones, of Jersey, half an ounce of
the tincture is sometimes administered in cases of
delirium tremens; this dose being repeated a
second or even a third time, in the course of six
or eight hours.</p>

<p>Digitalis is very uncertain in its action. When
given medicinally its effects should be watched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
as in some cases it probably accumulates in the
system, but in others, especially in heart disease,
it may be given for months or years without hurt,
and even with advantage. A poisonous dose
seems to produce vomiting, purging, colic, headache,
slowness and extreme irregularity of pulse,
dimness of vision, dilated pupils, lethargy, prostration,
convulsions, and coma. In two instances
death occurred within twenty-two hours. The
appearances found afterwards have been chiefly
congestion of the cerebral vessels and slight inflammation
of the stomach.</p>

<p><i>Digitalin</i> has acquired a certain importance from
the trial and execution of De La Pommerais for
poisoning the widow Pauw by its means. The
facts were altogether inconsistent with his innocence,
and though digitalin was not separated
from the woman’s body, yet extracts of the vomited
matters killed dogs with the symptoms of
poisoning by digitalis. The extracts obtained
from the stomach and bowels did not prove fatal.
Tardieu and Roussin, who were engaged on the
case, came to the conclusion that the woman had
been poisoned by some vegetable poison, probably
digitalin. The woman’s symptoms, which were
not, however, carefully noted, were violent vomiting
and extreme depression.</p>

<p>In addition to the administration of emetics and
castor oil, some infusion containing tannin, as
strong tea, &amp;c., should be given as an antidote in
poisoning by digitalis. Substances containing
tannin render the digitalin inert. Strong tea or
coffee, with brandy, will likewise be needed, to
lessen the depression and exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calabar Bean</span> (<i>Physostigma venenosum</i>).&mdash;This
bean, which grows on the West Coast of Africa,
is generally used as an ordeal. According to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
superstition of the natives the innocent vomit and
are safe, the guilty die. Its most characteristic
effect is contraction of the pupil. It seems to act
by paralyzing the motor muscles, leaving the
senses intact. There is great interference with
the heart’s action, it beating tumultuously, but
death seems to follow paralysis of the muscles of
respiration. In some cases, one fatal, occurring
in Liverpool, there was much vomiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tobacco</span> (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>).&mdash;All parts of this
plant are very poisonous. An infusion of the
leaves, exhibited as an enema, has, on several
occasions, speedily proved fatal. Persons in attempting
to acquire the habit of smoking often
suffer from severe nausea, vomiting, great prostration,
and insensibility; while in some instances,
more severe effects have ensued. Symptoms very
much resembling those of apoplexy have also been
produced by the excessive use of snuff. A celebrated
French poet died in fourteen hours, from
swallowing the contents of his snuff-box, which
had been mixed with his wine, as a joke. Snuff
or tobacco is also sometimes used for drugging
persons with a view to nefarious purposes, as
robbery and such like.</p>

<p><i>Nicotin</i>, the alkaloid of tobacco, is as deadly a
poison as prussic acid. It is an acrid, volatile,
oily liquid, of a pale amber color. In 1858 a
chemist of rising reputation committed suicide
with this substance. He was seen by one of the
attendants at the Museum in Jermyn Street, in the
act of falling forwards out of a water-closet in
which he had concealed himself. The attendant
raised him up, and with the aid of another man
endeavored to carry him to a table, but he heaved
a deep sigh and died in their arms. The appearances
afterwards found were great congestion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the membranes of the brain and a dark fluid state
of the blood.</p>

<p>The only other case of importance on record
was the occasion of the <i>cause célèbre</i> Bocarmé.
This man, a Belgian count, studied chemistry,
apparently, with a view to the preparation of this
substance, made it in quantity, and with the help
of his wife poisoned her brother. The count was
condemned and executed. M. Stas was engaged
to search for the poison, and thus was introduced
his process, so often referred to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conium</span> (<i>Conium maculatum</i>, <i>Common or Spotted
Hemlock</i>).&mdash;This indigenous plant, which grows
abundantly in hedges and wild places, belongs to
the order Umbelliferæ. The following common
umbelliferous plants are likewise poisonous: viz.,
the <i>Cicuta virosa</i> or water-hemlock, the roots of
which have been eaten in mistake for parsnips;
the <i>Œnanthe crocata</i>, or the water-dropwort, one
of the most virulent of English vegetables; the
<i>Æthusa cynapium</i>, or fool’s parsley, sometimes
gathered in mistake for parsley; and the <i>Phellandrium
aquaticum</i>, or fine-leaved water-hemlock,
popularly known as water-parsnip. They have
all given rise to accidents.</p>

<p>The seeds, leaves, and root of the <i>Conium maculatum</i>
are all poisonous. The effects are rather
variable, sometimes consisting chiefly of delirium,
stupor, coma, and convulsions; on other occasions,
the action, being chiefly exerted on the spinal cord,
gives rise to gradually extending paralysis, the
lower limbs being first affected, afterwards the
arms and chest, thus producing death by apnœa
from paralysis of the muscles of respiration.
Probably, however, could artificial respiration be
kept up, the heart would continue to beat much
longer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The alkaloid of hemlock is a pale yellow, volatile,
acrid oily-looking liquid, known as <i>conia</i>, <i>conein</i> or
<i>conicina</i>. It is a potent poison, occasioning general
paralysis without loss of sensibility. This alkaloid,
which is found in all parts of the plant, may be
readily recognized by rubbing with caustic potass.
This sets free the alkaloid from its combination,
and being readily volatile its mouse-like odor
becomes at once apparent. Chemically it is allied
to ammonia, and gives many of the reactions of
that substance.</p>

<p>In many respects <i>curare</i> (referred to under <i>Nux
vomica</i>) acts similarly to <i>conia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lobelia Inflata</span> (<i>Indian Tobacco</i>).&mdash;This plant
is a native of North America; and its powdered
leaves and seeds have been much used as a remedy
for asthma. In one instance, in which a quack
prescribed a drachm of the leaves, pain, vomiting,
unconsciousness, feebleness of pulse, and contraction
of the pupils supervened, and death occurred
in thirty-six hours. Ignorant imposters, calling
themselves &#8220;medical botanists&#8221; (more appropriately
known as &#8220;Coffinites&#8221;), have poisoned several
simple individuals, both in England and America,
by physicing them with this mischievous and
powerful drug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colchicum</span> (<i>Colchicum autumnale</i>, <i>Meadow Saffron</i>).&mdash;This
plant grows in most damp meadows.
Its noxious properties are due to the active principle
<i>Colchicia</i>, which in its effects is allied to that
contained in white hellebore, <i>Veratria</i>. In two
instances less than half a grain of colchicia proved
fatal to adults.</p>

<p><i>White Hellebore</i> (<i>Veratum album</i>) is a poisonous
plant which, when taken internally, has caused
violent sickness, purging, dilatation of the pupils,
great prostration, and lowering of the heart’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
action, cold sweats, convulsions, and death. At the
same time it is powerful in relieving pain. Its
properties are due to <i>veratria</i>, an alkaloid, which
may also be prepared from the seeds of the Asagræa
officinalis, or Cevadilla seeds, and from Veratrum
viride.</p>

<p>Gentle emetics, purgatives, and stimulants are
the means employed to prevent death in poisoning
by any of these vegetable substances. They all
produce extreme depression, hence stimulants
must be freely used.</p>

ASPHYXIANTS.</h2>

<h3>NOXIOUS GASES, PRODUCING NEUROTIC SYMPTOMS.</h3>

<p class="p2">The most important of these asphyxiant noxious
gases are carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, sulphuretted
hydrogen, and carburetted hydrogen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbonic Oxide</span> is a much more dangerous
poison than is carbonic acid, but poisoning with
it in a pure state is rare. It constitutes an ingredient
in most vapors produced by burning coke
or carbon, especially if the combustion is imperfect.
It forms with the coloring matter of the
blood a remarkably stable compound of a light
red color; in point of fact it is the impossibility
of exchanging carbonic acid for oxygen in the
lungs which causes death. After death the blood
is bright red in hue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbonic Acid Gas.</span>&mdash;This heavy inodorous gas
is the cause of numerous accidents, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
variety of sources from which it is produced. It
is formed from burning fuel, from the calcination
of limestone or chalk, and it is a product of respiration.
It is diffused through wells, coal-mines,
and caverns. During fermentation it is largely
given off, and accumulates in beer vats. The
vapor of charcoal partly owes its poisonous properties
to carbonic acid gas, as does that arising
from lime and brick-kilns.</p>

<p>In this country suicides rarely resort to carbonic
acid gas to accomplish their ends; in France they
very frequently do so.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;In its pure state this gas causes
death by asphyxia, the glottis becoming spasmodically
closed the moment the vapor comes in contact
with it. When sufficiently diluted to be inspired
it acts by absorption, giving rise to giddiness,
headache, vomiting, a tendency to sleep, and
loss of muscular power. The heat of the body
continues, and the limbs are usually flexible.
The countenance gets livid, the respiration becomes
hurried and stertorous, and complete insensibility
ensues; while the heart’s action, which
was at first rapid, soon ceases.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem Appearances.</i>&mdash;The body is generally
swollen and livid, especially about the face. The
countenance is not always bloated, sometimes
being calm and pale. The limbs are often rigid,
the skin is marked with livid patches, and the
abdomen is distended with gas. The right cavities
of the heart, the lungs, and large veins, are found
gorged with venous blood; while the brain and
its membranes are usually very vascular, and occasionally
there is serious effusion.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Prompt removal to the pure air,
cold affusion, and stimulating applications to the
chest and extremities, are the best means for resuscitation.
If the countenance is bloated, vene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>section
may be performed. Artificial respiration,
galvanism, and the inhalation of oxygen gas, have
been found useful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphuretted Hydrogen.</span>&mdash;This gas is a very
active poison, but from its offensive odor (resembling
that of rotten eggs) it is not so liable to be
accidentally inhaled as is carbonic acid. It is
usually met with combined with other gases, resulting
from the putrefaction of animal matter.
When breathed in a diluted state, it speedily produces
insensibility and death. Workmen long
engaged in drains and sewers, or in any atmosphere
contaminated with sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, suffer from giddiness, nausea, and weakness;
these symptoms ending at length in a kind of fever,
which is often fatal.</p>

<p>In acute cases there will be little hope of recovery,
unless the individual can be quickly
removed into the open air, and stimulants, &amp;c.,
applied. Chlorine gas, well diluted with common
air, might be employed, as it breaks up the gas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carburetted Hydrogen</span> (<i>Coal Gas</i>).&mdash;The
symptoms produced by this gas, when mixed with
air and inhaled, are those of asphyxia. If the
person breathing it should be roused before a fatal
quantity has been inhaled, the chief effects may
be intense headache, labored and oppressed respiration,
quickened action of the heart, sickness, and
great loss of power.</p>

<p>In 1841 a family in Strasburg were poisoned by
being in an atmosphere contaminated with coal
gas, for forty hours. Of the six members, four
were found dead, while the father died in twenty-four
hours; but the mother recovered. The gas
escaped from a pipe which passed under the cellar
of the house where this family resided; so that it
probably poisoned the air gradually, and gave rise
to no suffering to warn the unfortunates.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

ABORTIVES.</h2>

<h3>SUBSTANCES PRODUCING ABORTION.</h3>

<p class="p2">This group, though far from a natural one, is
nevertheless convenient. It comprehends a great
variety of substances, first among which comes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ergot of Rye</span> (<i>Spurred Rye</i>, <i>Secale cornatum</i>).&mdash;The
grain of wheat, barley, oats, and rye is apt to
be attacked by a parasitic fungus which imparts
to it specific properties. This substance has the
power of inducing contraction of unstriped muscular
fibre, especially in the smaller arteries and
uterus. Ergotised grain, in full doses, gives rise
to lassitude, headache, nausea, and diarrhœa.
From small quantities, frequently repeated, gangrene
of the extremities has resulted. The peculiar
influence of ergot on the muscular coat of the
uterus renders this agent a valuable medicine
when we wish to induce powerful contractions,
but in the hands of the ill-intentioned it is frequently
used to procure abortion; but its action
in this way is far from certain, and at all times
dangerous.</p>

<p>Savin and its oil are irritant poisons, only indirectly
affecting the uterus; nevertheless, they not
unfrequently are used to induce miscarriage.</p>

<p>Oil of Tansy has also been employed in America
as an abortive agent, and in three instances, at
least, has caused death.</p>

<p>The Yew (<i>Taxus baccata</i>), which has acquired
in certain districts a reputation as an abortive,
acts as do some others, by producing irritation of
the bowels, and so communicating a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
stimulus to the uterus. The leaves and berries of
the yew have both proved fatal, commonly with
irritant symptoms; but those of coma have also
been observed.</p>

<p>In America extract of Cotton-wood has a reputation
as an abortive.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</a></h2>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Bites of Venomous Reptiles.</span>&mdash;The poisonous
reptiles provided with fangs are the Ophidia, or
Serpents.</p>

<p>Accidents from serpents’ bites rarely, of course,
happen in this country, but are of frequent occurrence
in India, Australia, and America.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th October, 1852, one
of the keepers at the Zoological Gardens in the
Regent’s Park, was wounded by a cobra, which
he had removed from its cage and was playing
with. For twenty minutes after the animal bit
him at the root of the nose no peculiar symptoms
were manifested, and the part was merely bathed
with water. Forty minutes afterwards the man
was admitted into University College Hospital, his
face then being livid, respiration impeded, and
the power of locomotion imperfect. He pointed
to his throat as the seat of pain, but could not
speak, and was unable to swallow. Artificial respiration
was employed for fifty minutes, and subsequently
galvanism; but stupor rapidly succeeded
to faintness, and the patient died comatose fifty-five
minutes after admission. The chief appearances
found on dissection were an unnatural
fluidity and blackness of the blood, with great
congestion of the lungs and spleen.</p>

<p>The only poisonous reptile indigenous to this
country is the <i>common viper</i> or <i>adder</i>. It is found
on the heaths and in the dry woods of all parts of
England, Scotland, and Wales, and is much feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
on account of its venom. Very few cases are
known in which the bite of this animal has proved
fatal. In May, 1862, a little boy, at Burgess Hill,
near Brighton, clambered up a bank, to examine a
bird’s nest. Groping with his hand among the
moss, he felt, as he thought, a sharp prick from a
thorn. It turned out to be a bite from an adder.
As the real cause of the wound was not suspected,
the swelling of the hand and arm was not properly
attended to until too late, and the poor child
died on the second day.</p>

<p>The poison apparatus of the viper consists of a
gland placed by the side of the head, a duct, and
a fang or pointed curved tooth, moulded in the
form of a tube on either side. On being bitten,
the person has pain in the wounded part, which
quickly becomes severe and extends up the adjoining
tissues. The limb swells greatly, becomes red
and livid; while faintness soon sets in, and the
pulse gets rapid and small. Bilious vomitings,
dyspnœa, profuse cold sweats, jaundice, delirium,
and convulsions, have also been noticed. In a few
days the symptoms usually amend; but in weak
sickly individuals gangrene of the limb may follow,
or death may occur in the course of two or
three days.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of the bites of venomous reptiles
must be local and constitutional. Immediately
the wound is inflicted it should be sucked freely
and perseveringly. If the patient is too faint to do
this for himself, a bystander may fearlessly help
him; for it is well known that these poisons may
be smeared upon the lips and tongue, or even swallowed,
with impunity. At the same time a ligature
is to be placed around the limb, above the
wound; or if this be impossible, from its situation,
the textures around are to be compressed. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the bitten part may be excised; or it may be destroyed
by the actual cautery, nitric acid, the
strong liquor ammoniæ, or nitrate of silver.</p>

<p>Professor Halford, of the University of Melbourne,
in a paper published at the commencement
of 1869, recommended the injection of liquor ammoniæ
into the veins for snake bite. Of twenty
cases of snake bite since treated in this manner, by
different practitioners, recovery occurred in seventeen.
The snakes were all venomous, and included
the tiger snake, the brown and black snake of
Australia, &amp;c. These, according to Professor Halford,
are as deadly as the cobra and rattlesnakes
of India. The plan of proceeding is to expose the
vein, and then to pierce its coats with the sharp
point of a hypodermic syringe containing the
officinal liquor ammoniæ&mdash;sp. grav. 0·959. At
least thirty minims are to be employed; the dose
being repeated as the power of the preceding injection
is expended. Professor Halford formerly
thought that in consequence of the entrance of the
snake poison into the blood a rapid growth of new
cells occurred, which took up and exhausted the
fibrin and oxygen of the blood, and rendered them
incapable of ministering to the wants of the system.
He now thinks that the new corpuscles are
only the white corpuscles of the blood altered and
enlarged, the change in them being caused by an
alteration in the liquor sanguinis; this alteration
being, in fact, a disappearance of the fibrin under
the action of the poison. The ammonia is believed
to counteract this power, and in favor of this view
many Australian physicians have spoken strongly.
Dr. Fayrer, however, has found the proceeding a
failure in India. This gentleman is of opinion that
the activity of the poison in some Indian snakes is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
so great that it is impossible to counteract it by
any method.</p>

<p>The constitutional remedies are derived chiefly
from the class of diffusible stimulants. No agent
is more generally recommended than ammonia;
and therefore the officinal compound tincture of
ammonia (formerly known as eau de luce) should
be given in half-drachm doses, well diluted; or the
aromatic spirits of ammonia may be administered
in the proportion of two drachms to an ounce and
a half of water. Supposing that no ammonia is at
hand, brandy will prove an excellent substitute.
Transfusion of blood has been likewise recommended;
but I do not know of any instance in
which it has been resorted to.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Bites of Rabid Animals.</span>&mdash;As the subject of
Hydrophobia is fully treated of in Dr. Tanner’s
work on &#8220;The Practice of Medicine,&#8221; remarks are
here confined to the treatment to be adopted directly
a person is bitten by a rabid animal. This
is briefly as follows:&mdash;The tissues round the seat
of injury are to be compressed by a ligature or
otherwise, to prevent absorption. Then the
wounded part is to be excised as soon as possible;
taking care to remove every portion touched by
the animal’s teeth, and to obtain a clean raw surface.
The wound should then be thoroughly
washed by a stream of water, long poured over it,
and lunar caustic afterwards applied. Mr. Youatt
prefers the nitrate of silver, freely used, to every
other caustic; and he also recommends that after
its application the wound should be quickly healed,
though many authorities advise that it be kept
open by irritating ointments. As these operations
are very painful, there is no objection to the patient
being placed under the influence of chloroform.
He should afterwards be assured that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>thing
has been done to prevent any subsequent
mischief; and to give him greater confidence and
to banish all fear from his mind, it may be as well
to administer ammonia and bark for some days
after the accident.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Stings of Bees, etc.</span>&mdash;The poison apparatus
of the common bee consists of glands, and a sting
placed at the extremity of the body. The effect of
the bite is usually slight, and the pain quickly
passes off. In some few instances, however, there
have resulted swelling and erysipelas, or suppuration
and gangrene, or even death.</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1819, John Trevalli, of
Pennsylvania, was stung by a bee in the middle
finger of his right hand. He immediately became
faint and insensible to surrounding objects; his
complexion was livid, his breathing slow, and the
perspiration saturated his clothes. At the end of
an hour and a half he was bled, and recovered. On
the 21st July, 1820, he was stung in the temple by
a bumble bee. His wife was present and gave him
some water, but in ten minutes he was dead.&mdash;(<i>American
Journal of Medical Sciences</i>, Vol. 19, p.
265. Philadelphia, 1836.) Two other rapidly fatal
cases are noticed in the same journal, as well as
two examples of death from the sting of a wasp
and one from the bite of a spider.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Hanbury has recorded a case of death
from the sting of a bee (<i>Medical Times and Gazette</i>,
p. 232. 10th March, 1860); and has also given
short abstracts of several examples collected by
Dr. Crisp, where severe symptoms have resulted
from the same injury. Sir Benjamin Brodie (<i>Lectures
on Pathology and Surgery</i>, p. 286. London,
1846) says he has seen a case in which sloughing
of the cellular tissue followed from a leech bite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and another in which similar mischief followed
the sting of a bee. Both the patients died.</p>

<p>And again, in a communication from Montbard
(<i>La Patrie</i>, 19th September, 1858) it is stated that
a youth sixteen years of age was drinking from a
bottle, when a wasp, which he had not seen, got
into his throat and wounded him. He died suffocated
by the swelling, before any assistance could
be procured.</p>

<p>According to Messrs. Kirby and Spence (<i>Introduction
to Entomology</i>, Seventh Edition, p. 76,
London, 1856), serious effects are sometimes produced
on peculiar constitutions by eating freely of
honey or from partaking of mead&mdash;a drink made
by fermenting honey and water. These authors
state that they knew a lady upon whom such
things acted like poison, and they had heard of
instances in which death was the consequence.
Sometimes, when the bees have extracted their
sweets from poisonous plants, these injurious results
have not been confined to individuals of a
particular habit. Thus, according to Dr. Barton
(<i>American Philosophical Transactions</i>, vol. 5), there
were numerous deaths in the autumn and winter
of 1790 from eating honey collected in the neighborhood
of Philadelphia, which, on inquiry, was
found to be due to this substance having been extracted
from the beautiful but poisonous flowers
of the Kalmia latifolia.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> In the year 1839, a young lady residing in the north of
England took about half a pound of salt to rid herself of worms.
Very soon afterwards she began to suffer from all the effects of
an irritant poison, with general paralysis; and in spite of the
use of the stomach pump and of antidotes, she died in a few
hours. Dr. Christison has recorded two somewhat similar cases.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> If not kept prepared, the remedy may be speedily got ready
in any chemist’s shop in the following way: Mix together the
contents of the bottles containing tincture of the muriate of iron
(the liquor ferri perchloridi does as well) and liquor ammoniæ
fortior. Run the mixture through a loose filter, saving the precipitate;
turn filtering paper or tow, if that has been used, and
all into a vessel containing water, agitate well, and use the precipitate
by spoonfuls as it falls to the bottom.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> Considering the reprehensible way in which pseudo-medical
advice is given in some newspapers and cheap periodicals, it is
only surprising that more cases of poisoning do not occur. Take
the following example (<i>Sunday Times</i>, 3d October, 1847), of a
cure for dysentery: &#8220;Half a noggin of logwood, well boiled and
strained, half a glass of port wine, and twenty drops of laudanum,
have proved successful in checking dysentry in adults.
For children only fifteen drops of laudanum should be used.&#8221;</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
